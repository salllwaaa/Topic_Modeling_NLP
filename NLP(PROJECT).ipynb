            "['As part of a list of   “goof ball” suggestions, a Clinton confidante floated the idea of getting a popular music artist like Pitbull or “Timberlan” write a song for Hillary Clinton. [The revelation is part of a collection of thousands of emails posted by the organization Wikileaks, alleged to have come from the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.  In an August 2015 email, Capricia Marshall  —   former Chief of Protocol in the State Department while Hillary Clinton ran it and described in a September 2016 Politico profile as one of the friends “tamed” by the Clinton campaign  —   fires off some ideas for the campaign. Marshall, who is of Latin American descent, says the ideas are intended to help the campaign in “my focus  —   women and Latinas,” but are “goof ball [sic] suggestions” intended only as a jumping off point. One of these suggestions involves millennial engagement: The song  —   Not sure you are thinking of it yet  —   but I watched my son and his pals listen to music  —   they are similar to millennials. They only really listen to about 30 seconds  —   1 minute then switch to another song. With that in mind  —   if a producer like Timberlan [sic, producer Timbaland] Common or Pitbull produced a song for her  —   with an intro  —   i. e. “scratch” at the top and then have songs of the same theme from   artists who like her, cut into this produced song  —   it could be quite cool  —   I think?? Completely understand rights and costs here  —   but could be a cool factor.   Campaign manager Robby Mook responds to this suggestion, “I’m culturally inept so I leave this to JP [Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri] and others. ”     The Clinton campaign debuted a song during this year’s Democratic National Convention which did not feature any of these individuals. Instead, it was a cover of the Rachel Platten song “Fight Song,” sung acapella by a host of celebrities including actresses Elizabeth Banks, Jane Fonda, and America Ferrara. While both Common and Timbaland have endorsed Hillary Clinton, Pitbull has not, though he has vocally opposed Republican nominee Donald Trump.  ', 'Chicago (CNN) Speaking in public for the first time since leaving the White House three months ago, former President Barack Obama on Monday avoided criticizing his successor, disappointing anyone who was hoping for a clash between the   and President Donald Trump. In a nearly   forum, Obama laid out lessons he learned as a young community organizer here in Chicago decades ago and vowed to help bring up the next generation of leaders. He did not once mention Trump’s name. The University of Chicago hosted the event, billed by Obama’s office as a ”conversation on community organizing and civic engagement.” The highly anticipated public appearance happened just days ahead of the symbolically significant   mark for Trump    a milestone that one Obama adviser insisted is ”far from” the former president’s mind. In fact, Obama made clear on Monday that he has little interest so far in reemerging as a figure and spokesperson for the Democratic Party, notably declining to comment on issues like health care and foreign policy.  ”I’m spending a lot of time thinking about what is the most important thing I can do for my next job?” Obama said onstage. ”The single most important thing I can do is to help in any way I can prepare the next generation of leadership, to take up the baton, and to take their own crack at changing the word.” While Obama did not intend to directly confront or take swipes at Trump on Monday, an adviser said he wanted to be forthcoming    if asked    about where he stands on specific policy matters, including areas where he and Trump clearly disagree, a source said.  The closest Obama got to wading into a politically charged issue was when he discussed immigration, as he referred to many undocumented workers as simply ”families who are looking for a better life for their children.” ”It’s not like everybody on Ellis Island had all their papers straight,” Obama said. ”The truth is, the history of our immigration system has always been a little bit haphazard, a little bit loose.” After months of quiet travel, Obama to speak in Chicago, Obama, 55, reflected on the fact that when he came to Chicago more than 30 years ago as a    he was ”filled with idealism and absolute certainty that somehow I was going to change the world.” ”But I had no idea how,” Obama said. ”I am the first to acknowledge that I did not set the world on fire. Nor did I transform these communities in any significant way.” He later joked that the famous line from his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004    that there are not red states or blue states, but that there is rather one united country    was an ”aspirational comment.” Obama also took on several political and cultural developments that he lamented were exacerbating the country’s divisions, including gerrymandering, money in politics and the politicization of media. ”The internet in some ways has accelerated this sense of people having entirely separate conversations,” Obama said. ”If you’re liberal, then you’re on MSNBC. If you’re a conservative, you’re on Fox News.” He even shared a warning with young people about their prolific use of social media. ”If you had pictures of everything I’d done in high school, I probably wouldn’t have been President of the United States,” he said. ”I would advise all of you to be a little more circumspect about your selfies and what you take pictures of.” In the final stretch of the 2016 election, Obama actively campaigned for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. More than five months after Clinton’s loss, Obama is still not interested in taking center stage on politics, an adviser told CNN. ”He’s going to be more of an adviser behind the scenes and not necessarily be in the forefront right now,” the adviser said. ”At a given time, when it’s appropriate and necessary, he’ll be out there. But not right now.” Obama is also sensitive to creating space for and supporting his former administration officials in their new endeavors, including former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who is working to mentor young leaders, and former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is focused on redistricting laws across the country. Monday’s event came together because of Obama’s desire to speak directly with young people, a source close to the former President said. Three hundred students from universities around the Chicago area were invited to attend. On Sunday, Obama spoke at a roundtable discussion with young men from Chicago’s Create Real Economic Destiny program, which aims to provide job skills and positive connections to   youth. He was invited to participate by Duncan, the program’s founder. ”President Obama listened to the young men’s stories and shared some of the challenges that he faced growing up,” Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said of Sunday’s conversation. ”He expressed that he was optimistic about their potential to positively contribute to their communities and support their families because of the services provided in the program.” For the most part, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have steered clear of the public spotlight since leaving the White House. The former President has been spotted playing golf and vacationing on a private island in the Caribbean, but his schedule has been kept tightly under wraps. The Obamas are also busy working on their memoirs after landing a deal with Penguin Random House that could yield them tens of millions of dollars. The couple plans to live in Washington until their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates high school in 2019. Obama is also slated to appear with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin in late May and is due to accept an award in Boston prior to that. Obama ended Monday’s event on an optimistic note.  ”I have to say that there’s a reason why I’m always optimistic, even when things look like they’re not going the way I want,” he said. ”And that’s because of young people like this.”', 'Washington (CNN) Sen. Rand Paul on Sunday accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of misleading Republicans on the House GOP’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, at turns slamming the bill and setting out his own template for negotiations. Paul said on CBS’s ”Face the Nation” that Ryan was being misleading in presenting supporters of the bill, which is backed by President Donald Trump, as being inflexible when, in fact, Trump has signaled he is open to negotiations on the legislation. ”You know what I hear from Paul Ryan? ’It’s a binary choice, young man,’” Paul said. ”But what does a binary choice mean? His way or the highway.” The Kentucky senator said he rejected the premise that the President would not negotiate on the bill and anticipated that Ryan would not get the legislation, as written, through Congress. ”He will not have the votes,” Paul said.  Trump adds to chaos of health care deliberations, Paul railed against the bill, which he alternatively labeled ”Obamacare Lite” and ”Ryan’s plan,” saying it would not fix major problems in the health insurance market. He predicted that the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the impact of the legislation would show it would cover fewer people than Obamacare. ”CBO is going to come out and say a lot of people are not covered,” Paul said. The bill backed by Ryan and the President, dubbed ”the American Health Care Act,” would repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate requiring all people to have health care coverage, but it also would force people to pay a premium surcharge if they have a gap in coverage and then buy a policy on the individual market.  For this and other reasons, some analysts have said the bill would lead to a large drop in coverage. The CBO is expected to issue its assessment of the bill this week.  Ahead of that assessment, Ryan has slightly altered his messaging, indicating the CBO would say the bill would cover fewer people than the Affordable Care Act, but adding that this was not a fault of the bill, but an indication of economic ”freedom.” In a separate interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Ryan said, ”The one thing I’m certain will happen is CBO will say, ’Well, gosh, not as many people will get coverage.’ You know why? Because this isn’t a government mandate.” ”We’re not going to make an American do what they don’t want to do,” Ryan said. ”You get it if you want it.” Pressed to provide an estimate of the number of people who would lose coverage if his bill became law, the Wisconsin Republican said, ”It’s up to people.” Ryan made similar comments in an interview on Friday with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. ”We always know you’re never going to win a coverage beauty contest when it’s free market versus government mandates,” Ryan said. ”If the government says, ’Thou shall buy our health insurance,’ the government estimates are going to say people will comply and it will happen. And when you replace that with, ’We’re going to have a free market, and you buy what you want to buy,’ they’re going to say not nearly as many people are going to do that. That’s just going to happen.”', ' (CNN) You might want to chase that next beer with a little exercise. Exercising the recommended amount ”cancels out” the higher risk of cancer death brought about by drinking, a new study revealed. Similarly, physical activity lessened any greater risk of death resulting from any cause due to alcohol. With its ”very high standing” in Western culture, ”alcohol will continue to be abused despite the damage it causes to the health of individuals and society in general,” said Dr. Emmanuel Stamatakis, senior author of the study, which appeared today in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, and an associate professor at the University of Sydney’s medical school. Yet, policies to regulate consumption have never worked well, explained Stamatakis. Since people continue to drink, this realistic researcher and his colleagues decided to see whether the harms of drinking might be offset by the benefits of exercising. Observation over time, Stamatakis and his colleagues gathered data from health surveys conducted in England and Scotland. Then the researchers grouped the study participants    36, 370 people, all 40 years of age or older    into three categories: people who are not very active, those who do a moderate amount of exercising, and those who do the most. Next, the research team looked at alcohol use among the participants.  Calculating 5, 735 total deaths over an average   period of nearly 10 years per person, and crunching the numbers, the researchers discovered that compared with lifelong abstinence from alcohol, drinking at hazardous levels was linked to a heightened risk of death from all causes. Hazardous drinking is 8 to 20 US standard drinks for women and 21 to 49 for men, as defined by the researchers. And, the more alcohol units drunk each week, the greater the risk of death from cancer    even when a person drank less than the recommended maximum per week. The recommended weekly maximum, as defined, is 8 standard drinks for women and 12 for men.  However, all the numbers changed when Stamatakis and his colleagues factored exercise into their equations.  Specifically, they looked at the impact of the recommended amount of weekly exercise for adults, which is 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity. That includes brisk walking, swimming and mowing the lawn, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. HHS also advises strength training for all major muscle groups at least twice a week.  Exercising the recommended amount ”appeared to wipe off completely” the inflated risk of cancer death resulting from alcohol, said Stamatakis. Similar physical activity also offset the increased risk of   mortality linked to drinking. Exercising more provided slightly better results. One thing exercise did not moderate, though, was death risk among those who drank at harmful levels     ”over 20 US standard drinks per week for women and over 28 US standard drinks for men,” said Stamatakis.  The results also showed that occasional drinking    drinking alcohol sometimes but not every week    was associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease among physically active people.  ”I would have expected that the moderating effect of physical activity would be more pronounced for cardiovascular disease than for cancer mortality risk,” noted Stamatakis. Because it is an observational study, the results only ”suggest a relationship” between exercise, drinking and health benefits, said Michael Hyek, senior director of OhioHealth’s McConnell Heart Health Center. The researchers relied on   accounts of lifestyle factors, which may or may not be reliable, and they didn’t study eating habits or medication use or other factors that might play a role in how exercise plays into health when drinking is involved, noted Hyek, who was not involved in the research. Still, Stamatakis believes his study gives ”yet another reason” to promote physical activity and make the environment more conducive to physical activity and generally empower people to sit less. ”How many more reasons do we need for physical activity to be taken seriously?” he asked.    With this, Hyek has no argument. The benefits of moderate intensity exercise include stress reduction, the prevention, control and reversal of diabetes, and a positive impact on blood pressure, body weight and depression, he explained.  ”I know very few chronic medical conditions that exercise will not have a positive impact on,” said Hyek. ”It’s a good thing regardless of what your circumstances are.”', 'London (CNN) A pilot who allegedly passed out in the cockpit of a Boeing 737 in Canada was arrested on suspicion of being drunk, police said. Capt. Miroslav Gronych was ”behaving oddly before he became unconscious in the cockpit,” Calgary Police said.  The    Slovak national was due to fly the plane, with 99 passengers and six crew members, from Calgary to Regina and Winnipeg, before flying on to Cancun, Mexico. He was charged with having control of an aircraft while impaired. ”Initial tests conducted by police indicate the pilot was severely impaired by alcohol,” police said in a statement. Budget airline Sunwing apologized for their pilot’s behavior and commended the rest of the crew for their diligence in handling what they described as a ”very unfortunate matter.” Sunwing said the plane took off a short time after with a different pilot.', ' (CNN) His wife is accused of helping two convicted murderers break out of a New York prison. And the escape plan, a source says, also included a plot to end his life. But how much did Lyle Mitchell know? That’s one question investigators are asking as they search for two fugitives in a massive manhunt. The answer depends on whom you ask.  A source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN that prison tailor Joyce Mitchell knew the inmates had plotted to kill her husband, told him about their plans to break out of the facility and warned him that his life could be in danger. But a lawyer representing Lyle Mitchell said the husband, who also worked in the prison’s tailoring block, was kept in the dark. ”He didn’t know anything about the escape plan,” attorney Peter Dumas said. A jailhouse visit, At this point, investigators don’t believe Lyle Mitchell was involved in plotting the escape, the source with direct knowledge of the investigation said.  On Tuesday, Lyle Mitchell was face to face with his wife for the first time since her arrest last week. She’s accused of sneaking hacksaw blades, chisels, drill bits, a punch and other contraband into the convicts’ hands before they broke out. The couple spent an hour together and were separated by glass, speaking over a phone in a private, unmonitored conversation, Clinton County Sheriff David Favro said. Lyle Mitchell was supportive, and his wife seemed comforted by his visit    her first since her arrest, the sheriff said.  ”He’s providing support,” Dumas said. ”He’s not planning to testify on her behalf.” Joyce Mitchell’s attorney, Stephen Johnston, said he did not know what the two talked about. He described his client’s state of mind as ”distraught, very weepy and very upset.” Dumas said Lyle Mitchell  is also struggling to deal with what’s happened, and the revelation that ”possibly there was a plan to do some harm to him.” ”He’s very confused. It’s just a lot that’s been thrown on his plate right now,” Dumas said. ”He’s kind of reeling.” Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie has not commented much on the husband, other than to say he’s under investigation. Relationships under scrutiny, Investigators are looking into whether other prison workers were involved in the escape and whether other inmates might have helped create some type of diversion before, during or after Richard Matt and David Sweat escaped, the source said. Joyce Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to the two charges brought against her and has been talking to authorities. If convicted, she could face up to eight years behind bars. Authorities are investigating whether the two inmates threatened Mitchell to force her to help, the New York state official told CNN. Investigators believe Mitchell began getting cold feet about executing the plan but possibly had agreed to be the getaway driver because of threats to her and her husband, the official said. But her relationship with the prisoners was years in the making, authorities said. She’d been investigated in the past for an inappropriate relationship with Sweat that led corrections officials to move him out of the tailor shop in 2013 and keep them separated, said Wylie, the district attorney. That’s the year when she started having a sexual relationship with Matt, the source said. The sexual relationship took place at the tailor shop in the Clinton Correctional Facility, the only known place the two were together, the source said. Search area grows, With few clues pointing toward where Matt and Sweat went after they escaped, investigators are changing tack. It’s day 11 of the search, and now the area hundreds of law enforcement officers are combing is expanding, New York State Police said Tuesday evening. Teams will be redeployed to new areas near the prison in Dannemora, New York, police said, saying the shifting search zone was based on information uncovered so far in the hunt for the fugitives. More than 800 local, state and federal officers are popping open trunks, peering into cars and scouring heavily wooded areas. Canine units are also still searching for a scent that might lead police to Matt and Sweat, who escaped from the   facility known as ”Little Siberia” in upstate New York on June 6. Motion detectors and cameras have been placed in the woods, and an airplane able to fly at high altitude and detect movements on the ground is aiding in the search, a New York state official said. But despite promising leads, the official said, the search has gone cold. Authorities are also offering a $100, 000 reward for information leading to the escaped inmates’ arrests. It’s not clear how much has been spent, but judging from the boots on the ground, it can’t be cheap. Police have developed 1, 200 leads, according to New York State Police. But so far it’s not clear whether any of them will pan out. Authorities have said the killers could be anywhere    in Vermont, Mexico or still be in the woods near the prison. Despite promising leads last week    including an abandoned campfire, human tracks and a bloodhound picking up a possible scent    hopes of finding Matt and Sweat anytime soon appear to be on the wane, the state official said.

Trump taunted North Korea over its ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has said that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental missile “anytime and anywhere” in a rebuke to the incoming president. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly over the Pacific. In a New Year’s Day speech, Kim   North Korea’s leader, said his country had reached a “final stage” in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said, “It won’t happen!” On Sunday, an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, “The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by our supreme leadership. ” The spokesman’s remarks, made public on the KCNA website Monday, were in response to comments last Thursday by Antony J. Blinken, the United States deputy secretary of state, that North Korea had made “a qualitative improvement” in its missile capabilities over the past year. And he said Washington and its allies would continue “comprehensive, sustained pressure and sanctions” against the North. On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Ashton B. Carter, the departing secretary of defense, said the United States would shoot down a North Korean missile “if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies. ” It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM. Although it has displayed the     believed to be its first ICBM, during military parades in recent years, it has never   that system. In the past year, however, North Korea has boasted of successfully testing key technologies, such as   missile engines and heat shields for an ICBM. Last Tuesday, John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department, said Washington did not believe that North Korea had achieved its goal of tipping   missiles with nuclear warheads, though it continued to “march in that direction. ” North Korea has sought to develop by early 2018 miniaturized nuclear weapons that can fit atop a missile capable of reaching the United States, Thae   a former North Korean diplomat who defected, told the Yonhap news agency of South Korea on Sunday.', 'MADRID  —   A few days before Real Madrid and Barcelona were to meet in the first Clásico of last season, Madrid’s manager at the time, Rafael Benítez, sat down with the club’s president, Florentino Pérez. It was only November, and Benítez had been at his post for only a few months, but even at that early stage of the season, his position was shrouded in doubt. There was a lack of what the captain Sergio Ramos would later call “affinity” between Benítez, the cool, methodical manager, and the cadre of glittering stars that made up his squad. Performances had been stuttering, results imperfect: At Santiago Bernabéu, the   stadium where Real Madrid plays its matches, one loss and three draws in 11 league games does not cut it. When Benítez sat down across from Pérez, Real Madrid sat 3 points behind Barcelona in La Liga the word was that defeat would spell the end for the coach. Pérez, soothingly, offered reassurance. Benítez would not be fired, he told the manager, regardless of the result. A caveat, though, was concealed in the velvet glove. Pérez made it clear that Benítez was safe as long as he picked what the president felt was his strongest team: an adventurous lineup that included the Colombian midfielder James Rodríguez. Such a selection ran against Benítez’s cautious instincts. He would have preferred the more defensively minded Brazilian Casemiro as a bulwark against Barcelona’s formidable attack, but eventually Benítez relented. Rodríguez started Casemiro did not. Barcelona won,   humiliating Madrid on its home field. Benítez would cling to his job for only six more weeks. As Real Madrid and Barcelona prepare to come face to face again on Saturday at Camp Nou, Pérez will not be having any such frank conversations with Benítez’s successor. Casemiro, fitness permitting, is expected to start. Rodríguez almost certainly will not. In that one lineup decision lies not only proof of the power of Madrid’s new coach, Zinedine Zidane, but evidence of the source of it. Almost a year into his   managerial career, it is hard to find fault with Zidane’s record. He lifted the Champions League trophy after only six months, his third Champions League title with Real Madrid  —   one as a player, one as an assistant, one as coach  —   and the club’s 11th over all. His team sits atop La Liga, 6 points ahead of Barcelona. He has a win percentage of 81. 8. Statistically, he is the best manager in the history of Spain’s top division. Yet few rank Zidane, a taciturn, enigmatic Frenchman, as the equal of those   in place at many of Europe’s top clubs. The common perception is that he is not as inventive as Pep Guardiola, as inspirational as Jürgen Klopp, as astute as José Mourinho, as suave as Carlo Ancelotti. That view has its adherents, even at Real Madrid. Among the club’s hierarchy, there were always concerns that Zidane possessed the desire but not the ability to be a   manager. In 18 months with Castilla, Real’s B team, he was given every assistance: While the reserves had previously traveled to away games by bus, under Zidane’s aegis, they went by chartered jet. Still, he was hardly a resounding success. His training methods, particularly fitness work inspired by coaches like Gérard Houllier and Marcello Lippi, were seen as out of date   sessions designed to improve stamina had been phased out by many of his peers. There was no suggestion of a revolutionary tactical mind at work. The team’s results were unspectacular. Pérez, as late as the summer of 2015, was said to have been privately expressing his hope that Olympique Marseille would offer Zidane the chance to start his managerial career there, allowing him to learn his craft and make his mistakes away from Bernabéu. Pérez had always hoped that Zidane would prove to be Real’s equivalent to Guardiola, a genius schooled in the ways of the club. Pérez seemed resigned, though, that Zidane was more in line with Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea’s     Champions   coach in 2012, and Luis Enrique, a custodian of  —   rather than an upgrade to  —   Guardiola’s legacy at Barcelona. In some ways, Zidane’s time with Real’s first team has borne that out. There are still rumblings of discontent among the players that his training sessions are   his closest confidant on his staff is Luis Llopis, the goalkeeping coach. Jorge Jesus, the manager of Sporting Lisbon, insisted before his club faced Real Madrid in the Champions League last month that Zidane’s team “does some very interesting things tactically,” but Jesus declined to mention what any of them were. A   whitewash of city rival Atlético in November aside, there have been few   performances. Real Madrid tends to be reliant on brilliance from its individuals rather than the smooth operation of the team. The praise from Zidane’s players also has been telling: The Spanish midfielder Isco has suggested that Zidane lifted morale, while Cristiano Ronaldo pinpointed that the squad “feels his affection. ” Such tributes make Zidane sound more like a mascot than a manager. And yet results brook no debate. Zidane may not be a tactician or a visionary his presence is so brooding that it is impossible to imagine him as a   rhetorician. Instead, his strength may be something else entirely: charisma. In Ancelotti’s Italian autobiography, “Preferisco la Coppa” (I Prefer the Cup) he detailed the impression he had gleaned of Zidane while coaching him at Juventus. “He was the best player I have ever managed,” Ancelotti wrote, but what really stood out was the effect Zidane had on those around him. Ancelotti described how the Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli had been “hopelessly lost, in love” with Zidane. “I saw it dozens of times,” Ancelotti said. “Sometimes, his grandsons, John and Lapo Elkann, would be with him. They would say hello to the squad and go straight to Zidane. Then Luciano Moggi: to Zidane. Antonio Giraudo: to Zidane. Because Zidane was shy, and did not speak much, it was more than anything a conversation with yourself, but still, it was with Zidane. ” These were some of the most powerful people in Italian soccer, men used to obeisance from others, bending the knee. The players did likewise: In the same book, Ancelotti recounted a story from his first season in Turin, 1999, in which Zidane had been late arriving for a team bus. Ancelotti gave him 10 minutes to show up, and when he did not, Ancelotti ordered the bus to leave. Paolo Montero, a brutish Uruguayan central defender, then told Ancelotti in no uncertain terms that “without Zidane, nobody is going anywhere. ” The bus waited. That charisma has not receded. The best players rarely make the best managers  —   witness Diego Maradona  —   but in the case of Zidane, and Real Madrid, the fit is perfect. This is a squad that resented taking instruction from Benítez and Mourinho, who had never played at a high level, but which defers instinctively to Zidane. For all his flaws as a coach, a chronically political dressing room sits in his thrall. More significant still, Pérez does the same. The squad had long grown tired of the president’s interventions. One comment to Ronaldo, last season, suggesting after a game in which he had scored three goals that he should have had four, went down especially poorly. The players have mockingly known Pérez as abuelo, or grandfather, for some time that he is sufficiently awed by Zidane not to dictate team selections, to afford him independence, naturally places the players at the coach’s back, rather than in their more familiar position at their manager’s throat. Zidane’s power, his infallibility, is rooted in his charisma, his status. In that sense, Pérez has got what he wanted: his own Guardiola, a coach entirely in tune with his surroundings. Manchester United’s Alex Ferguson always said he felt the manager ought to be the   employee at any team, to put him in a position of strength. Zidane is not that, but he remains more of a Galactico, to borrow Pérez’s famous label, than any of his charges. Zidane may not produce a   collective, like Mourinho or Klopp or Guardiola, but Real Madrid has always been built around the cult of the individual. Zidane understands that. For him, and for his club, it works. Zidane may not be the perfect manager, but he could well be perfect for Real.', 'Saturday, The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin predicted on MSNBC’s “AM Joy” that the Democrats will take control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections and then move to impeach President Donald Trump.  Host Joy Reid asked, “I want to do a quick round robin and take your guys’ temperature on the likelihood of impeachment  —   impeachment with Republicans leading it, impeachment with Democrats leading it, or no impeachment at all. Jennifer Rubin, what of those three things do you think will happen?” “I think the Republicans will lose the House in 2018 and the Democrats will move to impeach,” Rubin responded. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent', ' (CNN) The night he made history as the first black man elected to the highest office in the land, Barack Obama began his message to the cheering crowd in Chicago’s Grant Park by saying his victory proved ”America is a place where all things are possible.” At his inauguration a couple months later, Obama celebrated the fact that he, a man whose father only 60 years ago might not have been served in a local restaurant, can now stand before the nearly 2 million people who packed the National Mall to take the oath of office. Now a house built by slaves would be home to a black first family.  ”I think that for every young child who grew up with an   president as president, it doesn’t seem like something unusual anymore. That’s all they’ve ever known,” said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser and close friend to both Obamas. ”That’s a good thing. It’s a sign of progress.” Some hoped the symbolic moment would usher in a new,   era in America, drawing the country swiftly toward a more perfect union.  But from the start, the president and others close to him saw that idea as naïve.  ”Such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society,” Obama told some 18, 000 fans during his farewell speech in Chicago last week. Jarrett expanded on that theme, arguing that it takes ”years and years and years for evolution to happen.”  In fact, six months into his term, one   incident would drive that point home, making it clear that many of the problems that have   the black experience in America would not be solved simply because a biracial man was president. At the end of a prime time East Room press conference, the president responded to a question about the arrest of a friend, black Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. on his front porch by Cambridge Police Sgt. James Crowley.   The President said the police ”acted stupidly,” which he later acknowledged in an interview with The Atlantic’s   Coates was a poor choice of words and said the uproar that followed those remarks drove home for him how much a president’s words matter. Obama would go on to invite Gates and Crowley to the White House for a conversation. It was the beginning of a discussion about race and policing that would last throughout his presidency, as police shootings of unarmed black men repeatedly sent protesters into the streets. But the ”acted stupidly” incident also hurt the president’s standing with white voters, prompting him to take a more cautious approach to discussing race over the next several years. Obama’s rhetoric and record, It was the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, not by a police officer, but by neighborhood watch volunteer, which prompted the President to speak about race in unusually personal terms. After a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman of murder charges, Obama spoke from the podium in the White House briefing room. ”When Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago and when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away,” he said.  Jarrett described the president as ”emotional” as he spoke with her about Martin’s death in the Oval Office and said it was important to him to try to personalize the experience to help people have a better understanding of what life in America is like for young black men. But even in the midst of the conversation on race these incidents sparked, the president has frequently admitted to being skeptical about the usefulness of ”talking” about issues of racial inequality    arguing such talk can be a distraction and that what was needed was concrete action to prevent discrimination. The president and his staff have long argued that many of his policies    like spurring job growth and passing the Affordable Care Act    had a disproportionately positive effect on blacks who were hit hard by the Great Recession.  His administration has worked to help improve relations between police departments and the communities they serve through his 21st Century Policing task force and has promoted more training for law enforcement officials and the use of police body cameras. During his presidency, the Justice Department launched more than two dozen investigations into police conduct. He has also pushed for criminal justice reform, becoming the first sitting president to visit a federal prison when he traveled to El Reno Federal Correctional Institution in Oklahoma, and setting a record for clemencies    granting pardons and commutations to more than 1, 300 people so far    many of them drug offenders.  Obama also launched a mentorship program    My Brother’s Keeper    aimed at improving the lives and economic prospects of young minority men. It is among the pursuits he says will continue after he leaves the White House. ”What the president’s approach has always been is, ’Let’s not pretend there aren’t issues. Let’s figure out how we can address them head on. Let’s see what we can do to bring people together to improve understanding so that we can embrace diversity and not fear it,’” Jarrett explained. ”That’s what he said after Trayvon Martin’s death. You know, he said why do we have a young boy walking down the street and he’s scary? What is it about him just simply walking down the street eating candy that creates fear? And it was really that and the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial that prompted the president to say let’s do some soul searching as a nation and what grew out of that was his My Brother’s Keeper initiative.” The president also struck a powerful chord in June 2015 when he delivered the eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney, one of nine worshippers at Charleston historic Emanuel AME church killed during by an avowed white supremacist who told investigators he wanted to start a race war. The president praised the grace of the families of those killed after many forgave admitted shooter Dylann Roof at his bond hearing just days later and called on everyone to guard against all kinds of racial bias, including ”the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal.” Obama’s critics, But Obama has also faced criticism from some in the black community for what they see as a penchant for lecturing black audiences on   ”respectability politics”    an approach that suggests marginalized groups deal with discrimination by changing their own behavior in order to get better treatment from those in power. He drew fire, for instance, for message he delivered at the 2013 commencement at Morehouse College, the historically black men’s college in Atlanta. ”Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination,” he told the graduates. ”Remember that whatever you’ve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured    and they overcame them. ” Some in the black community    notably commentator Tavis Smiley and the academic Cornel West    have also argued the President did not do enough to help the black community. Smiley, host and managing editor of Tavis Smiley on PBS, penned an open letter to the president in Time Magazine thanking him ”for seeing the world as it is, not as we wish it to be,” before going on to criticize him. ”I am anxious to see how you will attempt to impact the lives of those who were left behind during your two terms in the Oval Office,” Smiley wrote. ”Specifically, your most loyal constituency: black people.” In a recent essay titled ”Pity the sad legacy of Barack Obama,” West saved some of his harshest words for the president’s handling of racial issues. He bashed Obama for calling Baltimore black youth ”criminals and thugs,” slammed him for his praise of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, despite the city’s controversial    policies that targeted minorities, and said of black Obama supporters ”most black spokespeople shamelessly defended Obama’s silences and crimes in the name of racial symbolism and their own careerism.” Looking to the future, The president, known for his soaring oratory, often borrows language from notable figures in American history    quoting Presidents like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan and writers like Harper Lee. Among the people he has cited most frequently is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. whose bust sits in the Oval Office. In the midst of the civil rights struggle, King said, ”The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Many of the president’s supporters worry that arc    the progress toward racial justice    could begin to collapse under his successor, Donald Trump. Late in his victory speech in Grant Park on that historic night nearly a decade ago, the president praised what he called the ’true genius of America: that America can change. Our union can be perfected. What we’ve already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.”  He has said he leaves the White House still full of hope and pride at what he accomplished during his two terms in office. ”Yes, we can,” he said at his Chicago farewell, reprising his 2008 campaign slogan, before adding, ”Yes, we did.”', 'On Thursday CNN commentator Angela Rye denounced Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, claiming he is not fit to serve in a Donald Trump administration because he is “like a terrorist. ”[Rye said she was shocked that “someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as a Homeland Security Secretary.

Rye tried to defend her position by claiming that Sheriff Clarke had referred to those protesting Trump as “whiny babies. ” She added, “To be honest with you, there are black people in Milwaukee that would say to you, ‘Yeah, he is very much like a terrorist. ’” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

The win took Cindy Stowell’s total to $80, 002 in prize money.  A science content developer from Austin, Texas, Stowell died December 5 after a long battle with cancer, according to her longtime partner, Jason Hess.  ”Cindy came on ’Jeopardy!’ to play the game she loved and in doing so she was able to make a contribution to cancer research in the hopes that no one else would have to go through what she did,” her brother Greg, mother Carole, and Hess said in a statement. Stowell, 41, first appeared on an episode that aired Tuesday and was the winning contestant, with $22, 801. She won again on the show that aired Wednesday and took home $8, 199. A passion for the show, Stowell passed the initial online contestant test for the show early this year and moved on to the   audition phase in Oklahoma City. It was prior to her audition that she divulged her illness to a ”Jeopardy!” staffer, and spoke passionately about why she wanted to compete on the show. ”Do you have any idea how long it typically takes between an   interview and the taping date?” Stowell asked in a message to ”Jeopardy!” contestant producer Maggie Speak. ”I ask because I just found out that I don’t have too much longer to live. The doctor’s best guess is about six months.” Stowell wanted winnings to go to cancer charities, ”If there is the chance that I’d be able to still tape episodes of ’Jeopardy!’ if I were selected, I’d like to do that and donate any winnings to . .. charities involved in cancer research,” Stowell wrote. Stowell had been concerned that even if she passed the   test, the show would not be able to schedule her in the short amount of time she had left.  ”If it is unlikely that the turnaround time would be that quick, then I’d like to give up my try out spot to someone else,” Stowell wrote in her message to Speak. Show staff told Stowell to attend her Oklahoma City audition as scheduled. They said that, if she was selected to compete, they would book her appearance as soon as possible. She was selected and show producers kept their word, scheduling the taping of her appearance three weeks after the audition, on August 31. When Stowell got to the ”Jeopardy!” studios, she was fighting Stage 4 cancer, and only a handful of staffers, including longtime host Alex Trebek, knew she was sick.  Opponents unaware of illness, ”When Cindy Stowell taped her appearance on ”Jeopardy!” she had Stage 4 cancer,” Trebek said in a statement to CNN. ”Competing on ”Jeopardy!” was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and we’re glad she was able to do so.” Stowell’s opponents were unaware she was ill, according to a statement from the show. ”Jeopardy!” spokeswoman Alison Shapiro told CNN she is unaware of any other contestant dying prior to an episode airing for the first time.', ' (CNN) It’s not often that a   can claim to be a   from the off. But that’s precisely what’s happening in the auto industry, where Chinese unknown NextEV has launched what it claims is the world’s fastest electric car. John McIlroy is Deputy Editor of Auto Express and Carbuyer.   cars have been around for decades but only in the past five years or so have the mainstream manufacturers really started to take them seriously    prompted by tightening rules over when and where conventionally powered vehicles can be driven, and battery technology that has made them more usable in the real world. As such, there have already been a few upstarts, most notably Elon Musk’s Tesla, which confounded the giant car brands by launching precisely the vehicle they said was impossible at the time: a luxury executive saloon with a range of more than 200 miles. Truth be told, Tesla’s offering will still   NextEV’s NIO EP9 up to a point. But the NIO EP9’s pace has been judged over more than just a   drag race this   (1, 341bhp) creation has, in fact, proven its mettle around the famed Nurburgring in Germany, a 12.  monster of a race circuit known simply as ’The Green Hell.’ Breaking records, The 195mph NIO EP9 has lapped the track, NextEV claims, in just 7m 05. 12sec, or around 17 seconds faster than the previous electric car record. Indeed, to put it in context, the EP9’s time is only beaten in the   list by four   cars, two of them thinly disguised racers, and the other two supercars from Porsche and Lamborghini.  And yet the EP9 can be recharged from flat in as little as 45 minutes, to offer a range of more than 265 miles. There is no guarantee that it will deliver this in production, but if it does, it has the potential to rewrite the rules of the hypercar market. NextEV has committed so far to six examples, all reserved for the company’s initial investors. But, even with each EP9 costing around $1. 2 million to build, the firm may consider an additional small production run, if only to raise its global profile further. China is a hotbed of EV activity because crippling pollution in many cities has persuaded Beijing to open up that side of the business to ’ ’ companies. Some, like NextEV and telecoms   EV developer LeEco, appear to have enough backing to not only deliver a car, but to reach global customers. China’s growing electric vehicle market, They are not alone in sharing that ambition. Earlier this year, the   Beijing Auto International Corporation launched an EV   called ArcFox with a creation called the  . It has a 603bhp electric motor, is made mostly out of carbon fiber and can reach 60mph in less than three seconds    though its top speed is more modest than the EP9’s, at 155mph. Its range is more limited too, at 186 miles. Another brand, TechRules, has been testing an innovative hybrid supercar around the UK’s F1 GP venue, Silverstone.  The car carries the unusual moniker TREV, which actually stands for   Electric Vehicle, and it mixes plenty of   tech    including carbon fiber construction, a small   battery pack and   drive    to deliver a theoretical top speed of more than 217mph, while potentially running for more than 1, 242 miles between  .  Even the choice of fuel is open to interpretation one version of the car, called AT96, can run on aviation fuel, diesel or petrol, while the other, called GT96, is powered by natural gas. Read: Inside China’s largest ghost town, Qiantu Motor’s K50, another 2016 debutant, sits just below supercar territory, but even so, its mix of aluminum and carbon fiber construction, and   drive through a pair of electric motors, brings performance that will match many European creations    a top speed of 125mph and, more importantly,   in less than five seconds. Luxury car manufactures enter market, Still, the Chinese are not likely to have the ’electric hypercar’ space to themselves for very long. Desperate not to be beaten to the punch, the established car brands are now clamoring to get their own   offerings to market.  The giant VW Group is   development of electric components and already showcased one of the first cars that will use them    the Porsche Mission E. It’s a   electric saloon, but its performance will rival that of many sports cars and it should introduce new standards for   too. Read: Why China’s   are buying up   homes, Even the supercar elite who normally exist above the general industry are not immune to the demand for greater environmental credentials in their cars.  The fastest vehicles recently offered by Ferrari and McLaren have both featured electrification, and the British company has already admitted it is working on an   supercar.  Interestingly, though, these are names with history, so they have a reputation to protect    whereas NextEV and its like have hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and, at the same time, nothing to lose. Read: Is this where China’s billionaires stash their investments?  Winning over customers is about more than numbers, though. And this, in fact, may ultimately prove a bigger test for NextEV, TechRules and ArcFox than the technical challenge of getting around the Nurburgring (or, for that matter, actually bringing their cars to market at all).  In the past, buyers with the wherewithal to spend more than a million dollars on a car have been more drawn towards those brands with heritage. The Chinese brands must hope that the same does not apply to those who want not just an exclusive supercar, but also one that they can plug into the wall every evening.', '’  ’ ”   Former Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Eugene Monroe didn’t   give up football last year because he got too old, or because he   couldn’t hack it in one of the most lucrative positions in   football anymore  —   he left because of repeated head injuries. ” ’   And now, a year into his retirement, the    has taken up   a new cause: Convincing the NFL that players should be able to   use medical marijuana. ’ ’   ”  ’ ’   In the piece, Monroe discussed how his   love affair with   the game left him   and ”terrified” of   brain   injuries like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

O’Reilly declared Sessions was right to recuse himself from any investigations involving the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. However, he said this situation exposed hypocrisy of Democrats, who were silent on   General Loretta Lynch’s recusal when   presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton was being investigated for her use of an unauthorized server while secretary of state. Transcript as follows: O’REILLY: Hi, I am Bill O’Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recuses himself in the Russian investigation. That is a subject of this evening’s “Talking Points” memo. Okay. Here’s the deal. The Democratic Party in much of the national press wants to produce evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government in defeating Hillary Clinton. There is no question about that. The cost of the Russian hacking, a serious issue, there were hearings held in Congress. And by extension, when then Senator Jeff Sessions testified at his confirmation hearing for Attorney General, the Russian issue came up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AL FRANKEN (D) MINNESOTA: If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do? JEFF SESSIONS (R)   SENATOR: Senator Franken, I am not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians. And I am unable to comment on it. (END VIDEO CLIP) O’REILLY: Now, last night, “The Washington Post” publish a story that said,   Sessions did meet with the Russian ambassador twice last year. But if you are listening closely, the question was about the Trump campaign, not the former senators duties on the Armed Services Committee. Today in a press conference, the Attorney General reiterated that he was answering the Russian question in the context of the Trump campaign. He said he did nothing wrong, told the truth, but is recusing himself from the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SESSIONS: My staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluations. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore, I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign. (END VIDEO CLIP) O’REILLY: “Talking Points” believes Mr. Sessions did the right thing. The FBI is currently investigating whether Russians influence the presidential vote and he was involved. The investigation has to be above reproach. And that is why the Attorney General is now out of it. One footnote. Not one single Democrat in Congress, not one, called for   General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself from the Hillary Clinton investigation after she met with Bill Clinton at a Phoenix Airport. There was absolutely no call for recusal by the Democrats, so once again, hypocrisy is on full display. Now, here is what should happen going forward. The FBI should continue with its investigation and Director Comey should testify in front of Congress. If during that testimony there is evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in any way, then, a special prosecutor should be appointed. That is what should happen. A methodical investigation by the FBI and a determination by Congress whether a special independent probe is necessary. I think that is a fair, honest, and efficient game plan in this intense political climate. Finally, even though the press does want to destroy President Trump, the American people should want to know, we should want to know if there were any secret dealings with the Russians during the campaign. That is a very important story that should be defined. And that is the memo.

It was a sweet victory for US captain Davis Love III, who had been at the helm in 2012 when Europe fought back from a seemingly impossible position for an improbable victory at Medinah. But there was to be no repeat for Darren Clarke’s men as the US won for the first time since the 2008 match in Valhalla, Kentucky.  ”This team had to come together. We lost Arnold Palmer on Sunday, that was tragic for golf, that was a blow to our team to start the week, so many crazy things have happened,” he told Sky Sports. How the Ryder Cup was won, ”We’ve been kicked around for so long, you keep losing, you’ve got to do something different. We’re not going to win every one of them but we’re back on track,” he added.  Trailing by three points overnight, Clarke loaded the top of his order for the 12 singles matches with his star players, but it eventually proved to no avail. Patrick Reed, the outstanding performer for the US over the three days, struck an early decisive blow when he beat Rory McIlroy in a pulsating top match. Reed rolled home a   birdie putt on the 18th to finally close out a titanic contest littered with birdies and eagles. ”I really just think its the fans. It gets you going and keeps you going,” Reed said as he reflected on his victory. McIlroy, winner of the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup last weekend, looked crestfallen, receiving a consolation pat on his back from captain Clarke, but the boost to home morale was significant. Rickie Fowler also edged Olympic champion Justin Rose in another match that went the full distance with the home side coming out on top. It was not all   traffic as British Open champion Henrik Stenson beat an out of sorts Jordan Spieth 32, with debutant Thomas Pieters of Belgium again impressing with victory over JB Holmes by the same score.  It was the fourth point in five matches for one of Clarke’s wild card picks. Rafael Cabrera Bello, another of the six rookies in the Europe   followed suit against US PGA Champion Jimmy Walker but the middle and bottom of the order showed too much red on the scoreboard, signifying United States dominance. Veteran Phil Mickelson rammed home his 10th birdie of the day on the 18th but was matched by Sergio Garcia, the Spaniard with his ninth, as another epic encounter ended all square and personified the quality of golf on show.  Attention then turned to the matches where the home side needed the remaining one and a half points to reach 14   to reclaim the Ryder Cup. Brandt Snedeker beat England’s Andy Sullivan 31 to take the United States to 14 points and on the threshold of a famous victory, sealed by Moore, who came from a losing position to beat Lee Westwood on the final green. Moore, edged out by McIlroy for the Tour Championship in the playoff, had been Love’s final pick, but justified his selection at the last, winning the last three holes against veteran Westwood with an eagle, birdie, par finish. ”To score the clinching point in the Ryder Cup is just incredible,” Moore said. ”I can’t digest what just happened. I was trying my hardest not to let my team down.” Brooks Koepka, thrashing 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett 54, Dustin Johnson over Chris Wood and Zach Johnson against Matt Fitzgerald, also secured US wins. Martin Kaymer, who famously sealed the winning point at Medinah in 2012, rallied to beat Matt Kuchar, but it was too little too late for the Europe, which had won six of the previous seven contests. ”We’re all bitterly disappointed. We knew we had a lot to do after that opening session,” Clarke told Sky Sports. Read: US takes   first day lead, ”We couldn’t have done anything more.

Ryan initially suggested would scarcely change, amid grumblings that the White House is fuming over the plan’s   rollout. And Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump’s   partner in the endeavor after a year of campaign criticisms and mistrust, is insisting that all is going according to plan. “I would say that there is no intrigue, palace intrigue, divisions between the principals,” Mr. Ryan told reporters on Thursday, allowing that perhaps some “  staffers” felt differently. “We have a president,” he added, brandishing a fluency in the language of Trump, “who likes closing deals. ” For months, the halting union of Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan has weathered a stark divide in political ideology and style  —   a mutual acknowledgment, at least so far, that each man was critical to the other’s outsize governing ambitions. But with the health care bill staggering through the House, its fate uncertain, their alliance is facing an essential test, as White House officials and congressional leaders stare down the prospect of failing at their first major legislative heave. In less than two months, the party divisions that Mr. Trump exploited in his thundering campaign have resurfaced in the health care fight, even as Republicans control the White House and Congress. Already, some allies of Mr. Trump are moving to distance him from the potential fallout, privately suggesting that the speaker was never to be trusted in the first place. Administration officials have expressed frustration that there was not a better explanation of the   approach described by the House Republican leadership after the bill was unveiled, lamenting the resulting confusion. In recent days, Mr. Ryan has blitzed the news media, including several   outlets often hostile to the speaker, to make the case for the bill more forcefully than the president has seemed interested in doing himself. But Mr. Ryan has made clear that he alone does not bear the weight of the present challenge. “It’s not my bill,” he told CNN, noting that the White House had helped Congress draft it. “It’s our bill. ” As if for emphasis, he also noted that he talks to the president almost every day. For the president and the speaker, passage of the bill is about more than the health care debate it is a matter of demonstrating that major legislation  —   with the weight of the White House behind it  —   can sweep through a Republican Congress. On Capitol Hill, Republicans are already confronting concerns that a stumble on the first major agenda item would imperil future efforts on tax reform and a border wall. “The legislative window closes a lot sooner than people imagine,” said Peter Wehner, a former director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives under President George W. Bush, who has known Mr. Ryan for two decades. “It’s open the first year, and you better get things done. If you win, that builds on itself. And if you lose, that builds on itself. ” In an effort to appease conservatives, the White House is warming to a shortening of the Medicaid phaseout period in the current bill, among other changes, aiming to move the bill through the House and daring moderate Senate Republicans to stand in its way. Soon, Mr. Trump could take to the road himself to pressure potentially reluctant members in their states, according to a person briefed on the discussions. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence sought to galvanize House Republicans at a   session in the basement of the Capitol, where members dined on    and sought reassurances. Mr. Pence insisted that Mr. Trump was “spoiling for a fight” to see the process through to completion, according to an attendee. But while the White House has said publicly that collaboration has been smooth, the bill’s struggles have not gone unnoticed in Mr. Trump’s orbit. On Monday, a curiously timed report appeared on the   website Breitbart, often a repository of tea leaves for members of Mr. Trump’s circle. (It was once run by Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, a vocal Ryan critic in his old job.) Hours after the release of a damaging analysis on the health bill from the Congressional Budget Office, the site published leaked audio of Mr. Ryan telling House members last October that he could no longer defend Mr. Trump’s campaign. The content of the tape was not news Mr. Ryan’s view at the time was clear, just after the release of the “Access Hollywood” video in which Mr. Trump boasted of sexually assaulting women. But to admirers of Mr. Ryan, the message of the leak was unsubtle. “An audience of one,” Charlie Sykes, the longtime Wisconsin radio host and friend of Mr. Ryan’s, wrote on Twitter. It is not yet clear if the criticisms of Mr. Ryan are resonating with Mr. Trump. The president has been in regular contact with some Republican opponents of the bill in Congress, such as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. And while Mr. Trump has suggested that he will be able to blame Democrats for installing the Affordable Care Act in the first place, some of his advisers are dubious. Mr. Trump has also told people that if this effort fails, he will try again in two years. Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Mr. Trump’s and the chief executive of Newsmax Media, said the current plan betrays how the president has traditionally viewed government programs. “Trump should trust his own instincts,” said Mr. Ruddy, who wrote a column suggesting that Mr. Trump seek a bipartisan consensus bill. The administration figure perhaps the most invested in finding a legislative fix is Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, who is close with Mr. Ryan. While in Detroit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump pointed to Mr. Priebus and said he “may one day run a car company or maybe not,” before adding that he was doing a “great job. ” At a later event in Tennessee, after failing to mention the bill earlier in the day, Mr. Trump promised to “repeal and replace horrible and disastrous Obamacare,” repeatedly plugging the current legislation. Mr. Ryan  —   who during the campaign called Mr. Trump’s attacks on a judge of Mexican heritage “the textbook definition of a racist comment”  —   has scarcely said a cross word about him since the election. (He did allow on Thursday that he had “seen no evidence” to support Mr. Trump’s claim that President Barack Obama had wiretapped him.) The president’s assessment of Mr. Ryan has vacillated at least as much. In 2012, Mr. Trump thought Mr. Ryan was a dangerous choice as Mitt Romney’s running mate, and he was deeply critical of the congressman’s budget proposals to trim entitlement programs. After Mr. Ryan distanced himself in October, Mr. Trump savaged him as a “weak and ineffective leader. ” But by December, the two had reconciled. At a rally together in Wisconsin, Mr. Trump compared Mr. Ryan to “a fine wine” whose “genius” he had grown to appreciate. Then came the hedge: “Now, if he ever goes against me, I’m not going to say that. ”', 'Leon’s Frozen Custard’s English only policy is currently the cause of some controversy in Milwaukee, WI, per a Fox 59 report.  On Tuesday, customer Joey Sanchez overheard a conversation between a Leon’s Frozen Custard employees and a   customer. “She whispered to him in Spanish ‘I’m not allowed to speak Spanish to you,’” Sanchez said. Sanchez added that he tried to order in Spanish as well, but was told the same thing. Leon’s Frozen Custard owner Ron Schneider told reporters that his employees can only speak English on the job, and the policy has never been an issue before, despite being in place for a long time. “Hey, c’mon! It is America. We’ve spoken English for a long, long time,” Schneider said of the policy. “Any foreign language is going to be a problem. What I’m trying to avoid is when people come up here, get waited on in a different language because there happens to be an employee who speaks that language. ” Schneider, who told Fox 59 his wife is Hispanic, said they have never turned away a customer. “It’s going to get disruptive if we have to become bilingual, trilingual or anything else,” Schneider added. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent', ' (CNN) During the opening ceremony, the Rio Olympics organizers talked about a green environment. They were not talking about the pools at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre. But on Tuesday, the water in the pool where the divers for the women’s synchronized   platform competed    officially called a diving well    was dark green. The green hue seen in the water was due to a proliferation of algae caused by the heat and lack of wind in the venue, said the Rio 2016 Local Organizing Committee. In a statement released to the media, the committee stressed that the water was tested and there was no risk to athletes. It  also said the diving well should be back to its normal color for the events on Wednesday.  Follow Tuesday’s action with CNN’s Olympics live blog, Divers react  Meanwhile, the adjacent pool at the aquatics center, where water polo is being contested, looked normal. British diver Tom Daley, who took bronze in the men’s synchronized 10 meter platform, shared his confusion at the vastly different colored pools. While David Boudia, a US men’s diver who won silver on Monday night, wondered whether St. Patrick’s Day was being celebrated. Canadian Meaghan Befeito, who took bronze in the women’s 10 meter synchronized platform, said the green color may actually have her helped performance    provided she kept her mouth shut. ”It’s not the same color as the sky, so that was really on our side today,” she said. ”The only thing we said is, ’Don’t open your mouth in the water.’ Just in case.” Internet dives in  It didn’t take long for the Internet to offer up its own imaginative take on the green shade. Commenters joked that it was nice of Shrek to loan his swamp to the Olympics, while others shared pictures of Kermit the frog and swamp monsters.', 'Washington (CNN) Leaked emails from former Secretary of State Colin Powell show him strongly criticizing Donald Trump, labeling him a ”national disgrace and an international pariah.” He also called the birther movement, which the Republican presidential nominee helped lead, ”racist.” ”That’s what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn’t keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim,” Powell wrote in an August email. The messages, the existence of which were first reported by BuzzFeed and The Intercept, were posted to DCleaks, an organization affiliated with other recent hacks of   figures. Peggy Cifrino, an aide to Powell, told CNN: ”The emails are accurate. No further comment at this time.”  The emails are notable for their candor about Trump. Powell, who oversaw the State Department during the beginning of George W. Bush’s administration, hasn’t endorsed Trump and has largely sidestepped questions about his thoughts on the controversial GOP nominee.  Powell also lampooned Trump’s proposal that he could win over the   population. ”For him to say yesterday that within four years he would have 95% of blacks voting for him is schizo fantasy,” Powell wrote, adding, ”And (former Fox News chief Roger) Ailes as an adviser won’t heal with women.” READ: Roger Ailes picked wrong women to mess with, Moreover, the former secretary of state tore into Trump as an embarrassing figure to represent the United States.  ”Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah,” Powell wrote in June.  ”He appeals to the worst angels of the GOP nature and poor white folks,” Powell wrote in another email. As Trump’s lead in the Republican primary solidified, Powell complained to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria about the network’s political coverage.  READ: Why the 2016 presidential debates really matter, ”You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,” Powell wrote in December. On Wednesday night, Trump tweeted his disdain for Powell. ”I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster. We can do much better!” Trump said. Clinton ’kind of screws up with hubris’ But the messages also showed Powell angry with Hillary Clinton over her handling of her personal emails as secretary of state.  As The Intercept reported, Powell wrote in 2015, ”Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris.” The FBI released information from its investigation of Clinton’s email practices in July and August, and the notes it released showed Clinton indicating her practices came from Powell. Powell pushed back against this publicly, telling People magazine in August that Clinton’s people were trying to pin it on him. He said as much in his email, writing on August 23: ”(Clinton) didn’t need any advice or ok from me she was already doing it. I gave her written guidance on why and how I had been doing it.” Clinton appeared on CNN shortly thereafter and told Anderson Cooper that the blame rested with her.  Cheryl Mills, a former staffer for Clinton, forwarded the transcript of Clinton’s CNN interview to Powell, a leaked message shows.  He responded to Mills, calling the comments ”very nice.”  ”The only thing I would add is to simply say she had a private account on a public server before becoming SecState and continued to use it when she became SecState. On the other hand this might to lead to questions about the basement,” Powell said.  On August 28, he said that Clinton ”could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it. I told her staff three times not to try that gambit.” Wednesday’s email leak was not the first time Powell’s private thoughts were revealed. In 2013, a hacker known as ”Guccifer” infiltrated Powell’s email. The Romanian hacker, Marcel Lazar, also managed his way into the digital spaces of some members of the Bush family and Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal.  Lazar was sentenced to 52 months in prison on September 1. These leaks came from DCleaks on the same day a hacker by the alias ”Guccifer 2. 0” released more information from the Democratic National Committee. Experts have pointed to Russian state elements as the actors behind the DNC leaks. Powell, Rice talk Iraq War, An exchange in 2015 showed Powell and his successor, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, critiquing some of their former colleagues in the Bush administration. Rice forwarded a link to story about Bob Woodward slamming former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s recent commentary on the Iraq War.   Rice praised Woodward and added: ”First, we didn’t invade Iraq to bring democracy     but once we overthrew Saddam (Hussein) we had a view of what should follow. If Don and the Pentagon had done their job . .. things might have turned out differently.” Powell criticized ”Doug and Paul,” presumably Douglas J. Feith and Paul Wolfowitz, for their plan on Iraq and praised his former boss, President George W. Bush. ”43 (Bush, the 43rd president) knew what had to be done,” Powell wrote to Rice. ”As you say, the boys in the band were brain dead.”', 'Annie Karni writes in Politico that the young male staffers who helped elect Barack Obama and worked in his administration are now helping Obama’s erstwhile 2008 opponent Hillary Clinton. [From Politico:  The two former presidential aides, alongside fellow White House alums Tommy Vietor and Jon Lovett, are known as the quintessential “Obama bros”  —   a reference to the   group of young,   (and  ) operatives who helped Obama knock off Clinton in 2008, then followed him into the White House. Once among the toughest Clinton critics, they have become a unique and seemingly ubiquitous clique this election, manning their own   spin room for Clinton. With big followings on Twitter and a popular political podcast, “Keepin it 1600,” they act as wingmen for Clinton’s official spin shop  —   freer to drop bombs on Trump than her more constrained,     Brooklyn team.   …     For Favreau, at least, there is some penance driving him, in addition to his   fear of Trump. “I started off my political career not liking her very much at all,” he said of Clinton. “I developed a very different view of her in the White House, and thought we might have helped contribute, during the 2008 race, to the caricature of her that so many people have right now. ” Today, he calls her “an extraordinarily talented, brilliant public servant who should be president. ” Read the rest here. ', 'A recent history of mistakes,   and management blunders is woven into the fabric of Tribune Publishing, the struggling publisher of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. Now, the company may be about to add to the list. On Monday, Gannett, publisher of USA Today, disclosed an   $815 million bid for what is left of the Tribune publishing empire. But instead of Tribune’s board popping Champagne corks and shouting Hallelujah, it told Gannett, astonishingly, in effect: “Wait. We’re not sure we want to do that and, actually, we’re not sure we even want to talk to you about it. ” Two weeks ago and behind the scenes, Gannett made its bid, valued at $12. 25 a share, known to Tribune’s board in the form of a private letter. That’s 63 percent higher than Friday’s share price. At most public companies that at least pretend to think about their shareholders, a firm that gets an unsolicited offer hires bankers relatively quickly to sort out its options. And perhaps it engages in a bit of    with the suitor in hopes of feeling them out and maybe getting an even higher bid. Not Tribune. Its board sat on the offer for nearly 10 days without retaining outside advisers. Then, Tribune wrote Gannett a letter saying it was still working on hiring outside advisers, but is “in the midst of significant transformation,” and pointed out that the company will “undergo some change” after June 2, almost six weeks from now. While Tribune said it would “evaluate” the bid, the clear takeaway was that it wanted more time. You might ask, what’s magical about June 2? That is the day of Tribune’s annual meeting. More important, it is the day that two of Tribune’s board members step down. When that happens, Michael Ferro, an entrepreneur with next to no media experience who invested in the company earlier this year and became the company’s nonexecutive chairman, will have effectively mounted a coup of the board. Here’s how he did it. In February, Mr. Ferro’s company invested $44. 4 million in Tribune. In exchange, Mr. Ferro was given a seat on the board, bringing the board to seven people. Mr. Ferro then persuaded the board to fire Tribune’s chief executive, Jack Griffin, a media veteran, who was also a director. Mr. Ferro replaced him with Justin Dearborn, a former health care technology executive with zero experience in media. So, between him and Mr. Dearborn, he now controlled two seats on the board. He then pressed the board to expand to 10 people and added three people friendly to him  —   all, again, with no meaningful background in journalism. They are Carol Crenshaw, chief financial officer of the Chicago Community Trust Richard A. Reck, founder and president of Business Strategy Advisors and Donald Tang, a former banker who now runs a boutique focused on United   media deals. So now he has five friendly directors on a   board. But after June 2, when two previous directors step down, he will have a majority  —   five of eight. Tribune will tell you these directors are all independent. That’s true only insofar as they are not executives working at the company. But they are certainly insiders relative to Mr. Ferro. If Mr. Ferro, who said this year, “I wouldn’t sell for $50 a share,” according to Ken Doctor on NiemanLab, can get past June 2 without a deal, he will probably have the leeway to fully direct the process. He could choose to negotiate or perhaps he could stonewall. He could even try to take the company private himself. Who knows? Whatever the case, the idea that Tribune’s board has allowed this sort of behavior to take place is alarming. Given that Tribune Publishing was just spun off from Tribune Media and itself was a product of bankruptcy thanks to Sam Zell’s mismanagement of the company, it’s hard to argue that this company deserves the benefit of the doubt. Lance Vitanza, a media analyst at CRT, put it best. “Tribune Publishing has little history operating as an independent public company and may be unable to reach earnings targets,” he wrote in a note to investors. “Recent management upheaval creates numerous risks with respect to strategy and execution going forward. ” If you’re thinking to yourself, well, Tribune is a journalism company and simply selling to the highest bidder shouldn’t be the only consideration, you’re right. Tribune shouldn’t consider only dollars and cents. In this case, Gannett is offering Tribune a lifeline with potential to create a modicum of stability. It is hard to believe that Gannett’s offer is its last, or best. A company that is willing to go public with a bid is usually willing to bid more. Of course, there’s a chance that Tribune is engaging in an inscrutable courtship dance that will land a higher price. We’ll only know if Tribune first picks up the phone.', 'BERLIN  —   The Berlin police said early Tuesday that the killing of at least 12 people and the wounding of dozens more when a truck plowed through a Christmas market on Monday night was “a suspected terrorist attack. ” In a statement, the police added that they were working swiftly and with “necessary care” in the investigation. The truck jumped the sidewalk about 8 p. m. near the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, whose jagged spire, a reminder of the bombings during World War II, is one of the most symbolic sites in Berlin. The police said they later arrested a man near the scene who was suspected of driving the truck, which had been stolen from a worksite in Poland about a   drive from Berlin. A passenger, identified by the authorities as a Polish national, was found dead in the cab. There was no claim of responsibility, but the episode immediately evoked the attack in July in Nice, France, when a truck driver ran over and killed more than 80 people during Bastille Day celebrations. The impact scattered people who just moments before had been shopping and drinking mulled wine amid stands that sell Christmas gifts, sweets and sausages. At least 45 people were injured, including several with severe wounds, the authorities said. “People were sitting holding their heads, there were pools of blood on the floor,” said Emma Rushton, a British tourist, who was visiting Berlin for the first time and who watched as the truck crushed a stand right in front of her. Though it was never clear if the driver in Nice was linked to the Islamic State, the group’s exhortations to run over its enemies seemed to have inspired the killer, who had a long history of disturbed and violent behavior. If the Berlin attack turns out to have been carried out by someone who entered Germany as a migrant, it could produce yet another political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ms. Merkel has been sharply criticized for allowing one million migrants to enter the country, often without any screening or background checks. Heiko Maas, Germany’s justice minister, said that federal prosecutors had taken over the investigation of the episode, an indication that the authorities suspected terrorism. Andreas Geisel, Berlin’s top security official, initially insisted it could have been either an attack or an accident. And Thomas de Maizière, Germany’s interior minister, refused to use the word “attack” in an interview with the public broadcaster ARD. “The words we choose have a psychological effect on the whole country,” Mr. de Maizière said. “I am consciously avoiding using the word ‘attack,’ although there is a lot that points in that direction. ” Officials in Washington were less cautious in their characterization, based on similar attacks that the Islamic State seems to have inspired before, like the one in Nice. “The United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin,” the National Security Council said in a statement. Since Ms. Merkel’s decision in the summer of 2015 to throw open Germany’s borders to migrants and refugees, her country has grown jittery and concerned by security threats and the challenges of integrating the newcomers. An attack on a Christmas market would be likely to provoke particular ire. Christmas markets are a beloved German tradition that open on the first Sunday of Advent and attract thousands of visitors throughout December until Christmas Eve. Coming only days before Christmas, the crash left Germans numb and unnerved after months marked by a steady uptick of episodes, increasing in lethality. The year opened with scores of sexual assaults in Cologne for which migrants were blamed and reports of a threatened attack on Munich’s main railway station. Since February, four   terrorist attacks have been carried out in Germany by people who said they were motivated by the Islamic State, two of them refugees. One refugee injured five passengers on a train near Würzburg, and the other wounded 15 people when he detonated a bomb in his backpack near a concert in Ansbach. The attacks have helped to feed a growing populist movement and have helped the   nationalist Alternative for Germany party gain strength, with representation in half of the country’s 16 states. Ms. Merkel said on Monday she was in contact with Mr. de Maizière, the interior minister, and the mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller. “We mourn the dead and hope the many injured can be helped,” the chancellor’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Twitter. The police in Berlin said that a man had been found dead in the passenger seat of the cab of the truck, which had Polish license plates. Ariel Zurawski, whose  company owns the truck, said in a telephone interview that his cousin had been driving it and was a reliable individual who would not be capable of a deliberate act of terrorism. “I vouch for him. He’s my cousin and I’ve known him for ages. I trust him completely,” Mr. Zurawski said. “He’s very dedicated to his job. He’s a very experienced driver and always takes great care of the equipment. ” Mr. Zurawski said he had spoken to his cousin around noon and everything was fine, but he added that his cousin’s wife had been unable to get a hold of him when she called him about four hours later. “That was already a bad sign,” he said. Firefighters at the site could be seen surrounding the trailer of the truck, parked on the square at the base of the tower of the church. Emergency vehicles surrounded the square, which sits between two main streets that run through the heart of West Berlin. “It’s terrible to see this scene,” Mr. Müller said. “It’s exactly what we did not want to see in Berlin. ”', 'With the unlikelihood the Oakland Raiders will make their home in Los Angeles new overtures by a San Antonio businessman aims to bring the storied NFL franchise to the Alamo City. [Tuesday, former Spurs and Minnesota Vikings owner Red McCombs told radio station   1250 that his group has “got the whole program put together” on how to relocate the Raiders to San Antonio.  “We still have to get them to want to come here,” McCombs acknowledged. Referring to Raiders owner Marc Davis, the    billionaire observed, “He was born and raised there and he has a great feeling for the state of California. But it appears he is going to need to go somewhere. ”  McCombs claims the NFL’s decision to allow the St. Louis Rams to relocate back to L. A. and offering the San Diego Chargers the option to join them, “clears the runway” for the Raiders to move elsewhere. According to the San Antonio Express, Marc Davis declined to comment on the move to San Antonio. Breitbart News reported in the summer of 2014 that Davis met with San Antonio city leaders to discuss the possible relocation of the Raiders from Oakland to San Antonio. ESPN reports now that Los Angeles rejected the Raiders from moving to the City of Lights, Davis doesn’t know where his team would play in 2016. “We don’t have a lease right now at the Oakland Coliseum,” he said. “America, the world is a possibility for the Raider Nation. ”', 'Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million, making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record, with 359, 495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square, records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like “Chicago,” “Jersey Boys” and “The Lion King” the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example, $911, 000 by “Oh, Hello” at the Lyceum, which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17, by “The Illusionists”) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million, by “Hamilton”). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week, including seven that grossed more than $2 million, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: “Hamilton,” “Wicked” and “The Lion King. ” The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week, and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high, and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for “Hamilton,” now the industry leader in pricing, the average price was $310, and the top price was $998. (That’s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors, up from 58. 5 million the previous year, according to Christopher Heywood, a spokesman for NYC  Company, the city’s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year’s is always popular for tourists  —   and lucrative for Broadway  —   but especially so this winter, because Christmas and New Year’s fell on weekends, and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil’s first Broadway venture, “Paramour,” had its best week yet, at $1. 9 million, and “The Phantom of the Opera,” the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic, had its best week too, also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week, but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was “The Illusionists,” a holiday season magic show, which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday, and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years, and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: “Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,” “A Bronx Tale” and “Dear Evan Hansen. ” “The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway,” said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. “Matilda” closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and “Jersey Boys,” which closes on Jan. 15, set a record, too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: “The Humans,” which won the Tony for best new play last year, grossed an impressive $815, 000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course, the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29, as theaters clear the decks for a round of openings in late winter and spring.', 'Politico reports Sunday: “The push to block, rewrite and delay scores of   rules may be the [Trump] administration’s biggest untold success. ”[That declaration comes just one month after Politico mocked President Donald Trump’s efforts to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse his predecessor’s rules: none of it, Politco declared, “evoke[d] the      populism that Trump rode to the presidency. ”  “Trump’s ardent supporters and detractors alike tend to exaggerate the impact of the 13 rules he’s rescinding, out of more than 20, 000 approved under President Obama,” Politico’s Michael Grunwald wrote on April 10, adding: “For the most part   …     Republicans won’t score many political points with their CRA victories. ” He also argued that the deadline for repealing   regulations on the CRA had tolled (though others would argue it extended all the way back to the beginning of Obama’s presidency, covering any regulation that was not reported to Congress). At the time, Breitbart News called Trump’s use of the CRA a “legislative milestone,” arguing that Trump’s “use of the CRA to repeal regulations has put future administrations on notice that there is a limit to government’s regulatory reach, and that given the opportunity by the voters, conservatives will enforce those limits. ” Now, Politico’s Andrew Restuccia and Nancy Cook seem to agree  —   and they fill in the rest of the picture, noting that Trump’s executive orders and executive actions amount to “a series of actions that could reshape American life for decades  —   efforts to rewrite or wipe out regulations affecting everything from student loans and restaurant menus to internet privacy, workplace injuries and climate change. ” They add: Trump is   …     setting bureaucratic wheels in motion that could eventually ax or revise hundreds of regulations as agencies reorient themselves toward unwinding red tape and granting speedier approvals to projects   …     If successful, these efforts could represent the most   rollback of federal regulations since Ronald Reagan’s presidency, especially if Trump’s proposed budget cuts make it hard for a future Democratic president to reaccelerate the   apparatus. Trump’s assault on regulations represent a fulfillment of a core campaign promise, and the execution of what adviser Steve Bannon called in February the “deconstruction of the administrative state. ” Read the full Politico article here.

Trump on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. Trump’s afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters. Despite these advantages, Mrs. Clinton is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave Barack Obama two victories here, and offering Mr. Trump a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently. Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton is not earning the same support among Hispanics, young people or white voters that Mr. Obama captured when he eked out a Florida victory four years ago in the country’s most   swing state. Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose here and still find other routes to victory. Mr. Trump’s electoral map is narrower he must have Florida in his column. But as the most populous and one of the most racially diverse battleground states, Florida is also a bellwether for the nation: a candidate’s struggles here often are mirrored elsewhere. Polling in swing states that Mrs. Clinton once led, prompting predictions a month ago of an Election Day romp, now show Mr. Trump closing the gap or slightly ahead, including in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. “If she underperforms what Obama did in ’12, she’s not going to carry Florida,” said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami. A poll his firm conducted for Univision, released last week, showed Mrs. Clinton winning 53 percent of Florida Hispanics, compared with the 60 percent who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. After several weeks in which Mr. Trump attempted to sand off some of his rough edges and attacked Mrs. Clinton for portraying half his supporters as “deplorables,” the share of Florida voters who view the candidates unfavorably is now the same for Mr. Trump as for Mrs. Clinton, according to a   poll. In Miami on Friday, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton’s bodyguards should disarm and “see what happens to her,” a comment that could renew voters’ doubts about his fitness for the presidency. The Clinton campaign maintains it always expected the Florida race to be tight. “Two months before the election, Hillary Clinton is within a couple of points of where President Obama ended on Election Day with Hispanic voters, while Donald Trump has been drastically underperforming Romney by 10 points or more,” John Anzalone, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster for Florida, said in a statement. With 20 million people and 10 major media markets, Florida is a place of vast diversity and contrasts that is a challenging puzzle for any statewide campaign. The traditional playbook has been for Democrats to run up the score in South Florida, with its large nonwhite population, and for Republicans to rack up votes in the conservative panhandle. That leaves Central Florida, and especially Tampa on the Gulf Coast, as one of the state’s most contested swing areas. The booming region has the largest share of registered voters statewide, with one in four voters in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, registered as independents. “The old saying is: ‘As goes Hillsborough County, so goes Florida,’ ” said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Within this swing region, an epicenter of swing voters is the explosively growing New Tampa. It is a community of affordable subdivisions reached by grandiose landscaped entrances off a   highway, attracting young professionals with families. In interviews, undecided voters there seemed uncertain if they would cast ballots at all. Kish Nathan, 45, a computer professional born in India, voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. He has ruled out Mr. Trump, but is unenthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton. “I might not even vote,” he said. Leo Lewis, 51, was reading political news on a laptop outside a Starbucks. Mr. Trump scares him, Mr. Lewis said. Mrs. Clinton, he believes, is dissembling about her health. He, too, is considering sitting out the election. “The world has gotten so bad no matter what you do, no one’s going to fix it,” he said. Some strategists believe the pool of persuadable voters this year is shallower than in the past, which may explain why the tens of millions in TV ads run by Mrs. Clinton and her allies in the state have failed to give her a noticeable advantage. (Mr. Trump and outside supporters have spent about $8 million.) Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, said recently that the Clinton advertising push was a failure. “You give us $22 million, and I’ll produce more votes for you than a damn television ad,” Mr. Hastings told a meeting of Democrats, arguing that television does not reach young voters. Mrs. Clinton’s bulwark is her vast organizing effort, currently focused on registering new voters and signing up volunteers. But Republicans have not been idle: Field teams working for the Republican National Committee and state party have cut the Democrats’ advantage with registered voters in half since 2012. It is now just 258, 000 active voters. The Florida Democratic Party pointed out that of the 146, 000 newly registered Hispanic voters this year, only 15 percent are Republicans. “I want to make sure I give my vote to Hillary,” said Valesca Barilles, who registered for the first time with a Clinton volunteer outside a Dollar Tree store in Tampa last week. Born in Honduras, Ms. Barilles, an assistant bank branch manager, said of Mr. Trump, “I love the U. S. A. and I don’t think we need someone to come and ruin it. ” After poor   efforts during the primaries, Mr. Trump seems to be belatedly getting a ground game together. When he spoke in Pensacola, where the crowd was asked to text “Trump” to a number, some 3, 500 followed up on a reply message about how to check their voter registration, according to the campaign, and 1, 400 signed up to volunteer. “There is an army of R. N. C. volunteers and Trump volunteers crawling every part of this state every day,” said Susan Wiles, Mr. Trump’s state director. Mr. Trump must find a way to turn out a wave of white supporters who are infrequent voters. The campaign concedes that Mitt Romney’s field staff members four years ago drove conventional white turnout in Florida about as high as possible. In this state of   contests, every small demographic shift is closely watched. Mr. Obama won 37 percent of the state’s white vote in 2012. Mrs. Clinton is falling short of that number in    polls with Mr. Trump. “If she’s getting 34, 33, 35 among whites in Florida, I’m going to start to buy a lot of antacids,” said Steve Schale, who ran Mr. Obama’s Florida race in 2008 and was a senior adviser in 2012. Mrs. Clinton could make up for the erosion among whites by gaining with Hispanic voters. But so far, polls show Mrs. Clinton falling short of Mr. Obama’s 60 percent share of Florida Hispanics in 2012. “Against the candidate perceived to be the most hostile to Hispanic voters in modern presidential politics, why is she not exceeding where Barack Obama was?” Mr. Amandi, the Miami pollster, asked. He criticized the Clinton campaign for beginning   advertising only this month and for not doing a forum during the general election campaign with either Univision or Telemundo. “I think it’s too early to hit the panic button, but if these numbers by   aren’t at or slightly above where Obama was, there’s reason to be concerned,” he said. “She’s going to need all these votes to carry Florida. ” And Florida, he added, “is the whole enchilada. ”', 'AUSTIN, Tex.  —   Brodie Copeland, 11, one of the victims of the attack in Nice, France, was such a   baseball player that teammates at his club in Texas called him the “Copeland Crush. ” He played second base with the Hill Country Baseball Club, near Austin. The owner of the club, Jonathan Paiz, said Brodie got his nickname because he would “crush” it when at bat. “Basically he would get up there and hit the ball hard,” Mr. Paiz said in a telephone interview. Brodie and his father, Sean Copeland, 51, were two of the victims of the attack, which killed at least 82 others, including nine other children and teenagers, and wounded 202 people. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, noting that the attack occurred less than a year after the attacks in and around Paris, said that for the second time in nine months, the French flag was being flown over the Texas Governor’s Mansion in remembrance. “While every heinous attack like this is tragic,” he said in a statement, “this latest one hits close to home. ” The Copelands were the only two Americans who had been confirmed dead as of Friday night. Three students from the University of California, Berkeley, were among the wounded, according to a statement issued Friday by the university. Two of the students, Vladyslav Kostiuk, 23, and Diane Huang, 20, were discharged after medical treatment and returned to their summer dormitories in Nice, the university said. Daryus Medora, 21, whose leg was broken, remained in the hospital. A fourth student, Nicolas Leslie, 20, was unaccounted for on Friday. They were among 85 students who were on a study abroad program with the university. The Copeland family lives in Lakeway, Tex. near Austin. They were on a vacation that began in Pamplona and Barcelona, Spain, before moving on to southern France. Mr. Copeland was traveling with his wife, Kim, whose 40th birthday celebration on Monday was part of the reason they went on the trip. In addition to Brodie, Mr. Copeland’s other children, his son Austin, 22, and daughter, Maegan, 29, from a previous marriage accompanied them, said Jess Davis, a family representative. On Friday in Lakeway, an affluent Hill Country community, many neighbors of the Copelands were stunned that an act of violence in Europe could reach thousands of miles across the Atlantic to invade their peaceful town. “It’s heartbreaking for everybody,” said Dianne Wood, who lives a few houses up the street from the Copelands and knows the family well. “The Copelands are a sweet family, and we just want to respect their privacy. ” She described Brodie Copeland as “an incredible boy  —   so much life, so much personality. ” Coleen Serfoss, Brodie’s   teacher, remembered him as a “superstar” who stood out in class, on the baseball field and on stage. He aspired to become an actor and had performed in   productions of “Cinderella” and “Peter Pan. ” He was also in the school’s honor choir. As they said their goodbyes on the last day of class, Ms. Serfoss recalled, she told Brodie, “When you get your Academy Award, I hope you remember me. ” Her principal called her Thursday night to tell her that Brodie had died. “When I woke up, I was hoping it was a dream until I turned the TV on,” she said at a news conference outside Lakeway Elementary School. Grief over Brodie’s death was palpable among Lakeway teachers. “He was just a very sweet, kind young man,” said Joy Crenshaw, a   teacher who often saw Brodie in the school cafeteria. “He always had a smile on his face. ” A tribute to the father and son was set up on the Facebook page of the Hill Country team, where Brodie had been playing baseball since 2014. It shows Brodie frolicking in the French Riviera waters. “Immediately, he made an impact on all of the coaches at HC,” said a   page set up by Mr. Paiz, the baseball club’s owner. Mr. Copeland worked at Lexmark, the printing and software company, which issued a statement after his death: “Sean was not only a terrific leader in the company, but a phenomenal person who will be dearly missed. Our hearts go out to Sean and his family, and for everyone who is suffering in France and elsewhere from this senseless violent act. ” Two of Mr. Copeland’s brothers are set to fly to Nice with the State Department to pick up the family and bring everyone home, according to a statement provided by Ms. Davis. The baseball group’s Facebook page became a forum for remembrance and mourning. “No words can describe how we feel,” wrote Jeff Petry. “Sean and Brodie touched our lives in so many ways. Such a good man and a great kid and teammate. ” “We will miss you #8,” wrote another man, Bill Bishop, referring to Brodie’s jersey number. “You will be missed but we know you were needed for bigger and better things. ”', 'Border Patrol agents in southern California have arrested a previously deported, aggravated felon who had been convicted of homicide but has not served his sentence. [The agents detected two men walking along the International Border fence near Calexico, California. After they had detained the suspects, the agents determined they were illegal aliens who had no lawful right to be present in the United States. They arrested the men and transported them to the El Centro Border Patrol Station for processing. The El Centro Station has four border patrol stations and is responsible for surveying and protecting 70 miles of the U. S.  border.  When they reached the station and conducted background checks on the two men, the search revealed that one of them was    Humberto  . Alonso is a Guatemalan national previously convicted of felony homicide in 2003. A court sentenced him to a   prison term. “This arrest of a convicted felon, demonstrates the importance of the mission of the Border Patrol,” said Assistant Chief Patrol Agent David S. Kim in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “The hard work and dedication of our agents is a shield for our communities against a threat like this. ” The U. S. Attorney’s Office is expected to prosecute   for the crime of   after removal as a convicted felon. Although agents discovered the Guatemalan national as part of routine border patrol prevention, detection, and apprehension duties television, print, and online media have recently been ablaze with reports of immigration officials’ roundup of criminal illegal aliens. Open borders advocates and complicit news organizations have used the routine operations to advance their agenda with messages of misinformation and fear. They have painted pictures of sweeping raids and government retaliation under the new presidential administration. These arrests however, are part of routine U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations to protect the public from criminal foreign nationals. As reported by Breitbart Texas, ICE agents targeted illegal aliens in Operation Cross Check in May 2015 because they had felony convictions. Officials arrested 2, 059 criminal aliens, and 1, 000 of them had felony convictions for voluntary manslaughter, child pornography, robbery, sexual assault, and kidnapping.   of those apprehended were known gang members, and 89 were convicted sex offenders. A roundup in December netted 71 criminal illegal aliens. These criminals had convictions for drug trafficking, burglary, fraud, driving under the influence, weapons violations, and domestic violence. Another national operation in September put 36 more criminal aliens in jail. An operation called Operation Safe Nation and Operation No Safe Haven III apprehended 17 illegal immigrants who were thought to pose a public safety threat. Officials in foreign countries issued warrants for 19 individuals arrested during the operation for suspension of committing human rights violations. Officials with the University of Texas Immigration Clinic in Austin, Texas, has used recent ICE operations in the city to spread their political messages and cause panic. One of the operators of the clinic, Denise Gillman, told the Austin   that there has been an increase in activity by ICE officials. She added, “there’s a much bigger presence than the one that’s been acknowledged by ICE. ” She also was reported to say, “they’re making their presence known, driving around immigrant neighborhoods. ” Officials in the democratic city like Councilman Gregorio Casar has made Facebook posts that state: “I believe ICE is out in public arresting people in order to retaliate against our community for standing up for our values against people like Abbott and Trump. ” Open borders advocates have continued their fake news campaign against ICE, but generating panic places communities and law enforcement officers in unnecessary danger, say ICE officials.', 'Hong Kong (CNN) Tears rolled down Chen  ’s cheeks as, olive wreath atop her head and medal around her neck, she saluted the flag that rose above the stadium.  Follow all the Olympic action with CNN’s live coverage, But the anthem that played for the first Taiwanese athlete to ever win gold    she won gold at the 2004 Olympics in the lightweight taekwondo competition    was not the one Chen heard growing up, nor was the flag in front of her the red and blue of Taiwan.  Instead, Chen stood under the white banner of ”Chinese Taipei,” a nation that does not exist, the result of a political compromise stemming from divisions that have existed since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.  That compromise, which allows Taiwan to compete in the Olympics but not use its own name, flag or anthem, is increasingly starting to rankle among Taiwanese far more assertive of their identity and autonomy, especially in the wake of the election of President Tsai  .  One China? In 1971, Taiwan    officially the Republic of China (ROC)    was forced to withdraw from the United Nations after the General Assembly passed a motion recognizing the People’s Republic of China as the only lawful representative of China to the U. N.  Taiwan’s   democracy a sharp contrast to China’s   state. However, a shared cultural and linguistic heritage mostly endures    with Mandarin Chinese spoken as the official language in both places. Most countries do not maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, in deference to Beijing. Any recognition of Taiwan as a separate nation is resisted forcefully by China, including in the world of sport. In a statement, the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee said Taiwan’s membership of international organizations has been ”marginalized by the Chinese mainland” since 1971.  Taiwan boycotted the 1976 and 1980 Olympics after the host nations refused to allow the ROC to compete under that name.  In 1979, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) passed the Nagoya Resolution, conferring on Taiwan the name ”Chinese Taipei” and banning its Olympic committee from using the ROC flag or national anthem.  After a series of forceful objections, Taiwan officially accepted the compromise in 1981, and the island competed in its first Olympics in 1984, at the winter games in Sarajevo.  Changing identities  While Taiwan has participated in every Olympics for the past three decades, the compromise never sat well with many at home, and has grown more controversial as Taiwanese politics shifted in the direction of full independence from mainland China.  According to annual polls conducted by National Chengchi University, only 13. 6% of respondents in 1991   as Taiwanese by 2004, that number had risen to over 45%. A poll conducted this year by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation found that 80% of respondents described themselves as Taiwanese.  This is particularly true among the younger generations, many of whom participated in widespread protests against further economic integration with China  —   the   ”Sunflower Movement”  —   and supported the candidacy of recently inaugurated President Tsai.  ”We definitely want a peaceful relationship with China,” lawmaker and Sunflower Movement activist Huang   told CNN in January.  ”But that doesn’t mean we have to sacrifice our way of life.”  As Taiwan becomes more assertive of its identity at home, many are asking why it should not do so overseas as well.  Freddy Lim, a death metal frontman and lawmaker elected at the same time as Tsai, says the name ”Chinese Taipei” is ”disrespectful.”  ”Taiwan’s Olympic athletes come from all over the country and are of different ethnic backgrounds, so the best name for the team would be ’Taiwan’,” he told CNN. ”I hope the global community could see how Taiwan is treated internationally and support our efforts to participate in international affairs as a normal country.”  Coen Blaauw, executive director of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, which advocates for Taiwanese independence (Formosa is a historical name for the island of Taiwan) says the use of the name is damaging to Taiwan’s international standing.  ”Not only is the name ’Chinese Taipei’ humiliating for the 23 million people of the democratic country of Taiwan, we are concerned that the name will stick,” he told CNN. ”China’s veto power and approval over Taiwan’s role on the international stage should not be a prerequisite for Taiwanese participation in international organizations like the Olympics.”  DK Dang, chairman of World United Formosans for Independence, says he hopes Tsai’s administration will pressure the IOC to allow Taiwan to compete under its own name.  Tsai’s office did not respond to a request for comment. China has maintained that nothing is permissible on the international stage if it suggests there are ”two Chinas.”', 'Fashion industry public relations firm LaForce has canceled its annual holiday bash in New York City due to Donald Trump’s stunning victory over Hillary Clinton in this year’s presidential election. [According to the New York Post‘s Page Six, firm chief James LaForce and his husband Stephen Henderson sent out a letter to invitees stating that the annual industry party  —   originally set for December 19 at Manhattan’s Irving Plaza, with a one   guest list  —   would no longer be happening this year.  “We envisioned an   celebration of Hillary Clinton’s presidency,” the letter to invitees read, according to a copy obtained by Women’s Wear Daily. “Alas, Election Day did not go as we’d hoped. So it’s with deep regret that we are canceling this year’s party. ” “As Hillary said in her concession speech: ‘Let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come,’” the letter concluded, along with a promise of more parties in the future. The invitations to the bash, printed up before Election Day on November 8, had featured a caricature of Clinton wearing a red Santa hat and captioned with the words, “Make America Merry Again. ” The invitation called for guests to come dressed “patridiotically. ” LaForce  —   which includes among its clients such big names as Target, Banana Republic, Swarovski and Perry Ellis  —   had reportedly planned to incorporate nude male models painted with    body paint at the party. Now, the firm will instead donate the money meant for the party to progressive groups including Planned Parenthood, Housing Works and the Stonewall Foundation. “We just decided we couldn’t go through with it,” James LaForce told the Post.

In 2009, the cost was estimated at $900 million.  Trump signals that he would make saving money on military projects a priority as president. “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th,” he wrote. Trump also mentioned the   program during an interview on Fox News Sunday, pointing out that government officials who made the deals with contractors, usually ended up working for them. “The people that are making these deals for the government, they should never be allowed to go to work for these companies,” he said. “You know, they make a deal like that and two or three years later, you see them working for these companies that made the deal. ” UPDATE: Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp. dropped as much 3. 4 percent after Trump’s tweet, according to Bloomberg News.', 'Doors were bolted shut and parking lots emptied at ITT Technical Institutes around the country this week after the chain of   colleges announced it was closing for good. At some campuses, though, this was not the first time students and employees found themselves locked out. More than a decade ago, in 2004, federal agents, search warrants in hand, swooped into the company’s offices in eight states, closing schools briefly as they hunted for evidence of fraud related to student recruitment, enrollment, dropout rates, grade inflation, loans, and reported job placements and salaries. The collapse of ITT, one of the nation’s largest   educational chains, may have seemed sudden, coming less than two weeks after the Education Department  —   citing financial instability and the likely loss of accreditation  —   barred the parent company from enrolling new students using federal funds. But the unraveling stretches further back, to a time when ITT was a Wall Street darling, raking in record profits. “It has been a long time coming,” said Carrie Wofford, president of the nonprofit Veterans Education Success and the former senior counsel to a Senate committee investigating   colleges. There was “a lack of fair play that was particularly true at ITT and some others. ” Founded at the end of World War II as part of the original International Telephone  Telegraph, the career schools operation split off into an independent, publicly traded corporation in the  . The switch came as liberals and conservatives began a wholehearted embrace of privatization on the theory that professionally managed,   businesses could do a better job of delivering public services than nonprofits or the government. Investors, thinking that the   education sector was the next big thing, swarmed. With transformations in the economy, more and more working adults were turning to training programs where factory hands could learn to use computers or home health care aides could earn a nursing degree. Providers like ITT Technical Institutes held out the promise, not just of a good job for eager young prospects, but of steady growth in enrollment and revenue as well. From 2000 to 2003, the sector outran every other on Wall Street. Publicly traded    shares climbed 460 percent, according to one analysis, compared with a 24 percent loss for the Standard  Poor’s   index. Some mutual fund managers boasted that the schools’ owner, ITT, had been their most profitable stock. Yet even as business was booming, troubling accusations of abusive practices in the industry like the ones that resulted in the 2004 federal raid bubbled up. That investigation, brought initially by the United States attorney’s office in Houston, was ultimately closed, but suspicions continued to trail ITT and other   giants. The next year, ITT agreed to a $725, 000 settlement with California after employees revealed that the company inflated grades to qualify students for state financial aid. Several investors, convinced company officials had lied to them, filed securities fraud lawsuits. A major grievance was that the industry was overselling programs that left enrollees with deep debt and degrees that had little value in the job market. Students weren’t the only potential victims so were taxpayers. The company said it was more concerned with the present than the past. “We’re involved in the complicated and   process of closing our academic institutions after approximately 50 years of outstanding service to students and employers who hire them,” said Nicole Elam, a spokeswoman for ITT Technical Institutes. “When students have been abruptly forced into the streets and employees’ livelihood ripped from them,” she added, “regurgitating unproven allegations as a means to justify this horrific end is shameless. ”   colleges were a magnet for billions of dollars in federal student loans and grants to   students. In 2010, they gobbled up more than $32 billion, a quarter of all federal financial aid, nearly double their share less than a decade earlier, the Senate committee inquiry found. Hundreds of millions more flowed in from the Pentagon and veterans’ programs through the G. I. Bill. For ITT, the total haul in federal dollars that year equaled $1. 1 billion. Absent that steady stream of public funds, these privately managed businesses would collapse. With Wall Street demanding steady growth, the pressure on the company’s managers was relentless. The chain was adding eight to 10 new campuses a year, according to the Senate committee. Former employees said recruiters pushed to enroll more and more students  —   regardless of their preparation, chances of graduating or ability to repay their loans  —   even as the company pared instructional costs and raised tuition to increase profits. Although the investigations temporarily depressed ITT’s stock, within a few years, the company was soaring to new heights thanks to an otherwise disastrous development: the Great Recession. As employers shed workers, many more people returned to school, taking on enormous debts in the hope of bolstering their credentials and skills and improving their chances on the job market. Profits took off, but so did disenchantment with the industry. Aggrieved students, graduates who found their degrees of little value, even insiders who became   turned to online websites and watchdog groups. Many filed complaints with state prosecutors and regulators, the Education Department and lawmakers. They reported deceptive marketing   recruitment tactics misleading information about costs, courses, graduation and job placement rates inflated enrollment numbers    schemes subpar instruction and more. Ms. Wofford of Veterans Education Success said that every time the government tried to clamp down on an abuse, some   colleges would come up with a scheme to circumvent the rule, like a private loan program set up by ITT to keep the pipeline of federal funds flowing. “There’s a perniciousness that’s disturbing,” Ms. Wofford said. Some employees tried to change company practices. Rodney Lipscomb, the former dean of academic affairs at an ITT campus in Tallahassee, Fla. said he was on the job six months, “when I really started to say something’s not right. ” Hired in the spring of 2011, he was disturbed by the aggressive recruitment, something he had never seen during his two decades at public educational institutions. Former students returned to the school, stunned by letters demanding payment for   loans they knew nothing about. Worst of all, he said, staff members would then persuade those same students to   in unrelated programs and take on even more debt as a way of deferring the loans that were already due. He started filing reports, detailing his concerns. “I really believed at that time, I could fix it if I got to the right folks,” said Mr. Lipscomb, who now works for a community college in Texas. “But the higher I reported up the chain, the worse the environment got for me. ” Finally he was told a lawyer from the company’s headquarters in Indiana and the district manager were coming to Florida to meet with him. “I was very happy,” he said. “I thought they were going to take action. ” Instead, Mr. Lipscomb said, they told him that if he continued to report his complaints, he would be fired. In 2015, he was. He has since filed a   suit against ITT Technical Institutes in federal court, accusing the company of defrauding the government of money and wrongful termination. Beyond the spate of private lawsuits, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 19 states have either investigated or sued ITT. The Education Department actively monitored the company’s finances starting in 2014. But it was last month’s ban on enrolling new students with federal funds that delivered the death blow. Now many current as well as former students have been left stranded. “This has a huge impact on my life,” said Chris Blank, a    former Marine who was studying electrical engineering at an ITT campus in California. “I relied on G. I. benefits. They are all basically wasted and I can’t get any of those back. ”', 'A SpaceX rocket prompted a wave of 911 calls after it created a series of sonic booms while   the Earth’s atmosphere at around 1am on Monday.

[A student activist group at Boston University calling themselves “DivestBU” is demanding that alumni withhold donations, according to a recent series of posts on social media. According to the students, frustrated with their lack of progress in swaying administrators and trustees into divesting their interests in the fossil fuel industry, students are now turning to alumni and asking them to pause their contributions to the university until such a change is made.  “DivestBU asks alumni to withhold donations to Boston University until it divests from companies continuing to explore for fossil fuel reserves. We expect hits to the university’s rankings, reputation, and financial reserves to force the administration to pay attention to student voices, but are dismayed that this is what it takes,” the group wrote in a Facebook post. The students are trying to obtain 2, 000 alumni signatures on a petition designed to force the university’s hand into divesting their interest in fossil fuels. The students cite a report that claims that a large portion of the university’s operating budget comes from alumni donations. They believe that if they are successful in obtaining alumni support, the university will have no other option but to comply. “Considering the leadership role of the university, I find it contradictory that BU invests its endowment —  and therefore my donation —  in the fossil fuel industry. The extraction and consumption of fossil fuels harms the environment, public health, and exacerbates the already negative consequences of climate change,” the alumni pledge reads. “Given this injustice and the urgency of acting on climate change, I pledge to withhold all monetary donations to BU, starting in September 2017, until the university publicly commits, within a transparent and measurable framework, to the complete ACSRI recommendation of full divestment of all direct investments in fossil fuel companies that continue to explore for new reserves,” it continues. It is unclear how many alumni have signed onto the pledge thus far, but the students behind it claim that they feel that 2, 000 signatures “is a large enough number to afford legitimacy to [his] petition. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,    ', ' (CNN) The killing of black honor student Jordan Edwards by police in Balch Springs, Texas, and the failure of the Justice Department to charge Baton Rouge police officers in the death of Alton Sterling provide further proof of a systemic problem of police violence. Sadly, the Justice Department, now led by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is unlikely to tackle this issue. A top student and athlete, Edwards, 15, was shot to death when a police officer fired his rifle into a car in the Dallas suburb. The officer was later terminated.   This comes as the Justice Department has refused to charge two police officers in the July 5, 2016, convenience store shooting of Sterling. A bystander’s video showed police pinning Sterling to the ground before shooting him. The Sterling case marks the first   police shooting decision made under Sessions’ watch. And it appears as if Sessions’      philosophy is already starting to influence the way decisions are made in his department.   So we shouldn’t hold our breath waiting for the attorney general to press charges in the death of Edwards    or anyone killed by the police, for that matter. Sessions’ record on race and civil rights is legendary. In 1986, during the Reagan years,   nominee Sessions was denied a seat on the federal bench due to accusations of racial animosity toward blacks. Lawyers at the Justice Department and the US Attorney’s Office in Alabama had testified that Sessions called a black prosecutor a ”boy” and warned him ”to be careful what he said to white folks,” told a white civil rights attorney he was ”a disgrace to his race,” and said the ACLU and the NAACP were ” ” and ” ” organizations that ”forced civil rights down the throats of people.”   Coretta Scott King even wrote a letter to Congress at the time, urging members to block his nomination because of his alleged malicious and fraudulent prosecution of civil rights activists when he was a US attorney in Alabama.  And though Sessions denied these allegations, his nomination did not make it out of committee    notably in a   Senate.   Sessions’ supporters say he has changed since those allegations were made against him in the 1980s, but many    myself included    are still suspect. During the 2016 campaign, Sessions was a devoted cheerleader for   Trump’s law and order,    platform. Despite his controversial record, Sessions was confirmed for the position of America’s top prosecutor by the Senate.  He received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police and other law enforcement organizations, who believed he would side with the police. And after he was confirmed, David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, tweeted, ”Thank God After 8 Horrible Years Of Black Radical Marxists We Finally Have An AG Who Will Defend Decent American People   Rather Than Thugs.”  In addition, the white nationalist website Daily Stormer applauded Sessions as ”An Aggressive   Racist,” predicting that ”We’re Going To Get Absolutely Everything We Wanted.”  Sessions says he detests the Klan and white nationalism, and that all claims of racism are a distortion of the truth. But so far Sessions has not disappointed his supporters. Although there is no evidence for it, he has attributed an increase in violent crime to a lack of respect for police officers, claiming ”in recent years law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable deeds of a few bad actors.”  Further, Sessions has made it clear that he will take a step back and review the more than 20 consent decrees governing over 20 cities in the US. Consent decrees mean that these cities have agreed to work with the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, under court supervision, to overhaul their police departments, enact certain reforms and improve relations with their respective communities. Sessions said he believes these consent decrees lower police morale, and he opposes the federal government’s role in ”dictating to local police how to do their jobs    or spending scarce federal resources to sue them in court.” But problems policing in America is not a matter of a few bad apples, as Sessions suggests, but a systemic issue in police culture and law enforcement practices. These tragic, senseless incidents, such as the killing of Jordan Edwards and Alton Sterling, are a reminder of this reality. And there are likely to be more, particularly if police feel they will not be prosecuted for using excessive or unwarranted force. There is no reason to believe that Sessions will do anything to reform plagued police departments, hold them accountable to the public or seek justice for the victims of police violence. Despite his image as being   he serves neither the police nor the communities they serve when he normalizes the festering wounds of police brutality and misconduct and the longstanding mistreatment of communities of color.  When innocent, unarmed honor students are shot, we have a problem.  But the new attorney general will not solve this problem    he will only make it worse, largely because he does not believe a problem exists.', 'People who wear Islamic clothing such as a burqa are more likely to become radicalised and plot terror attacks, the President of Kyrgyzstan, Almazbek Atambayev has said. His remarks, which have provoked widespread criticism, were offered as part of a national debate on Kyrgyzstan’s cultural identity. [His comments, made at a press conference, follow several weeks of controversy over   hoardings going up which urged Kyrgyz women not to adopt clothing such as the burqa, niqab or hijab, the BBC has reported.  The President has previously made it clear that he has no problem with Muslim traditions, but opposes the ‘Arabization’ of Kyrgyzstan, the population of which is about 80 percent Muslim. The hoardings show contrasting images: to the left a group of women dressed in traditional Kyrgyz attire, to the right a group of women in niqabs and black burqas, covering all but their eyes. Under the images, white text in a red arrow pointing towards the right reads: “Poor people! Where are we heading to?” Responding to criticism of the advert, President Atambayev said: “When we erected banners some smart people appeared and started pointing at miniskirts. Our women have been wearing miniskirts since 1950s, and they never thought about wearing an explosive belt. “You can wear even tarpaulin boots on your head, but do not organise bombings. This is not religion. Let them wear even miniskirts but there must not be any blasts. ” He asserted that the wearing of Islamic garb is not only out of step with the Kyrgyz national culture, but also has the potential to radicalise the wearer. “Terrorists are insane people,” he said. “Clothes also can change one’s thoughts sometimes. “When we were searching for prisoners who had escaped a detention centre, Melis Turganbayev [the former interior minister] came to me and said that they had been eavesdropping on telephone conversations of wives and mistresses of criminals. Their wives and mistresses wore sacks on their heads and they wanted to organise bombings. ” Addressing to those who adopt Islamic veils and values, he continued: “If you do not like Kyrgyzstan you can leave our country and go wherever you want. We can pay your travel expenses, even to Syria. ” A state commission has ruled that the hoardings do not breach advertising laws, but the Spiritual Board of Muslims of Kyrgyzstan, a   organisation, has slammed the ads as “provocative,” claiming that they undermine the unity of the Kyrgyz people. Some citizens have also shared images on social media critically comparing western clothes to hijabs and bemoaning the westernisation of Kyrgyz culture. But President Atambayev has long made it clear that he views the wearing of veils not as a sign of adherence to Islam but as evidence of Arab influence on the country. In 2014, speaking at a session of Kyrgyzstan’s Security Council, the President made it clear that he has no problem with conservative clothing, nor with Muslim traditions, but with the “Arabisation of society [and the] deprivation of the Kyrgyz nation of its language and traditions”. Burqas, niqabs and other veils are Saudi Arabian in origin their use has spread through the Muslim world along with the strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam as promoted by groups including Islamic State.', 'Sweden’s newly appointed   coordinator attracted criticism yesterday after seeming to suggest Islamic terrorism is caused by the “white power movement”. [Hours after her appointment to the post of coordinator against violent extremism on Tuesday, Anna Carlstedt was asked why Sweden is the country which has the most jihadists per capita travelling to the Middle East to fight with extremist groups.  She told Swedish Radio: “I think there are several different types of hotbeds of extremism. What we see is that there is an interaction between them. It is true that Islamic extremism is growing, but this also results from the extreme   white power movement. ” Asserting that “there is an interaction between these two movements because society is becoming more and more polarised” Carlsted went on to link Islamist terror with Swedes who are unhappy with politicians in the country. “[A]s I said earlier, we are seeing increased extremism and we see a lot of threats and hatred of elected representatives, officials and others. It is something that exists in Sweden and we see it in many other countries. ” “It is very important to take advantage of the good forces [‘civil society’] and not let fear and darkness win,” she added. Against the backdrop of an Islamist terror attack having struck Berlin on Monday night, Swedes on social media were sceptical about the appointment of Carlstedt, who has no relevant experience in the fields of terrorism and extremism. Svenska Dagbladet lead writer Ivar Arpi wrote: “New coordinator against violent extremism hinted recently in Studio One that the white power movement causes jihadists to travel to Syria. Crikey. ” Nya samordnaren mot våldsbejakande extremism antydde nyss i Studio Ett att vit   gör att jihadister reser till Syrien. Jösses.  —   Ivar Arpi (@Ivarpi) December 20, 2016,  Referring to her appearance on Swedish Radio, another user directed a tweet at Carlstedt which joked, “the White Power movement must be enormous in Tunisia because so many go from there to the way of jihad”.

She writes: “Success requires Carlstedt speak clearly. In all the interviews I’ve read, she describes the extremists as ‘left and right, all religions’. My confidence is zero if Carlstedt persists in not mentioning jihad by name. ”', 'TEL AVIV  —   When she went on five television talk shows to deliver the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi attacks, UN Ambassador Susan Rice says she did not even know about the existence of the CIA Annex in Benghazi. [The CIA Annex was one of two targets of the very attacks that she was discussing on September 16, 2012, when Rice infamously appeared on five morning talk shows  —   on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, and CNN  —   telling the story of protests that erupted “spontaneously” as a result of a “hateful video” offending Islam.  The other target was the U. S. Special Mission, which was attacked first and located about 1. 2 miles from the CIA Annex.  The startling admission about her lack of knowledge of the events was provided by Rice herself in testimony to the House and was contained in the final report of the House Republicans Select Committee on Benghazi released on Tuesday and reviewed in full by Breitbart Jerusalem. Ben Rhodes, the White House’s Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications and Speechwriting, has admitted that he selected Rice to represent the administration’s views and appear on the talk shows five days after the attacks. The Benghazi report finds that Rice was Rhode’s third choice after Hillary Clinton and then National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon declined. In doing so, the Committee found, “the administration selected an individual who did not even know there was a CIA presence in Benghazi, let alone the fact that two Americans had died there. ” The Benghazi report quotes from Rice’s testimony on the subject, where she admits she was ill informed: Q: Did you learn between September 11 and September 16 that were was a CIA presence in Benghazi? A: I think —  no. I think I learned subsequently. Q: So nobody told you between the dates of September 11 and September 16 that two of the four Americans who were killed who were providing security actually worked for the CIA and not the State Department? A: Not that I recall. Q: All right. And you learned that subsequently? A: To the best of my recollection, I learned it subsequently. With research by Joshua Klein.

[The transgender change in school regulations was imposed last night during a dramatic board meeting where only 12   witnesses were invited to testify.  The board members met on Thursday night only after being informed the night before that the discipline change would be considered. No opposing voices were allowed to be heard, parents were relegated to shouting opposition from the seats and some were ejected from the meeting. The Student’s Rights and Responsibilities Handbook is issued to each student every year. Students are required to sign, along with their parents. Violations of the handbook are treated as discipline violations that can result in either suspension or expulsion from school. The new regulation reads: No student in FCPS shall   …     on the basis of gender identity   …     be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. This “discrimination” language means that a student who speaks out against the “gender identity” ideology can be disciplined, and presumably suspended and even expelled, according to board member Elizabeth Schultz, who opposed the change. Schultz says the school district  —   which is one of the largest in the country, with 187, 000 students  —   “punishes students all the time for what they say on social media, even outside of the school year. Without a doubt, students will be punished for saying negative things on Facebook and Twitter about transgenderism. ” Schultz said the board met last year to accept a new policy on “gender identity” but agreed that any change regarding discipline would only be considered after a lengthy study and an open hearing where all voices could be heard. Instead, the board was informed on the night of June 8, Wednesday, that the discipline issue would be considered on Thursday night. Schultz tells Breitbart News that the Thursday night rule leaves many questions unanswered, including “who can play on what teams, what bathrooms students will be allowed to use. We keep putting things into practice without even considering the ramifications. ” Schultz says one of the problems in instituting such regulations is uncertainty about what they mean. For example, Schultz asked board legal counsel on Thursday whether “a boy who identifies as a boy is included in gender identity protections?” In a very testy exchange, the legal counsel said he did not know. Board member Ryan McElveen, who sponsored the trans motion, told Schultz the question was inappropriate. Other questions left unanswered, according to Schultz, is “who can play on what teams and what bathrooms people can use. ” She said these questions are all open particularly because of the ongoing litigation going on around the country. One of the objections from Schultz and two other board members is how the issue came to be considered on Thursday night. Last year, they were promised a lengthy investigation and a full hearing. Instead, it was foisted upon them with less than 24  . On Monday, officials quietly invited people to speak at the event   —   but all 12 slot were taken in eight minutes by 12   witnesses. “How did they know three days in advance, even before the board knew, that this issue would be considered on Thursday night?” Schultz asked. The American College of Pediatricians has issued a report saying that transgenderism in children is dangerous. They have determined that testosterone shots and other   medical interventions are a form of child abuse. There are a mere 700, 000 transsexuals in the United States, according to the   Williams Institute at the University of California  —   Los Angeles. Only, 90, 000 people have moved to change their name based on sex changes, according to a study of 2010 federal data. This means this massive and fundamental change is being imposed on all kids for the benefit of a tiny sliver of the American populace. In general, the transgender ideology says government should push every American to validate every person’s choice of created “gender identity,” even though a man who wants to be a woman is still a man by every known scientific measure of evolutionary life. For example, an Oregon law recently allowed a jury to award $60, 000 t0 a transgender teacher because other teachers declined to use the teacher’s preferred pronoun, which is “they” rather than “him” or “her. ” Deputies for President Barack Obama have backed similar rules for all   schools, and New York City has established similar   rules. The ideology’s claim that the government must enforce a new right to “gender identity” also means that the governments must ignore and often dismantle many civic rules that evolved to help the two distinct sexes  —   men and boys, women and girls  —   meet their legally equal, but different and complementary, needs.  For example, the transgender ideological demand means that   bathrooms and locker rooms must opened up to people of the opposite sex, regardless of age, and without any verification of created “gender identity. ” As a result, it is now an offense in Washington State to ask a man in a woman’s bathroom if he thinks he is male or female. Similarly, Obama and gay advocacy groups have slammed a popular North Carolina law, dubbed HB2, because it requires people to undergo medical procedures before they can use a bathroom reserved for the opposite sex. Teenage boys who say they are girls are also allowed to compete against girl athletes  —   and to bump them off the winner’s podium. Students in at least two schools have protested the new ideology, which are being imposed on children in Oregon, Washington and several other states. Recent polls show the public strongly opposes the federal   ideology in schools.  ', ' (CNN) Emma Watson is the new Belle of the ”Beast.” The ”Harry Potter” star revealed Monday that she’s been cast as Belle in the   version of ”Beauty and the Beast.” Disney confirmed the news. The film will be directed by Bill Condon (”Gods and Monsters,” the final two ”Twilight” films). According to the Internet Movie Database, Stephen Chbosky (”The Perks of Being a Wallflower”) will have a hand in the screenplay. The original ”Beauty and the Beast,” from 1991, was the first animated feature to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. It featured the voices of Robby Benson as the Beast and Paige O’Hara as Belle, and it included the memorable songs ”Be Our Guest” and ”Something There.” It was turned into a Broadway musical in 1994, the first of Disney’s animated films to make the jump to Broadway. Naturally, the Internet went completely nuts over the news. Fans will have to wait a while, though. The film isn’t even scheduled to go into production until later this year. No release date has been announced.', ' (CNN) ISIS is arguably the most successful militant group ever, seizing huge chunks of Iraq and Syria, declaring itself a state and governing territory for several years and counting. But where did ISIS come from? What does it control? And how does it govern? CNN explains.  Where did ISIS come from? The group began in 2004 as al Qaeda in Iraq, before rebranding as ISIS two years later. It was an ally of    and had similarities with    Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda: both were radical   militant groups devoted to establishing an independent Islamic state in the region. But ISIS    unlike al Qaeda, which disowned the group in early 2014    has proven to be more brutal and more effective at controlling territory it has seized. ISIS put governing structures in place to rule the territories it conquers once the dust settles on the battlefield. From the cabinet and the governors to the financial and legislative bodies, ISIS’ bureaucratic hierarchy looks a lot like those of some of the Western countries whose values it rejects    if you take away the democracy and add in a council to consider who should be beheaded. Oil and land: What ISIS controls, ISIS spread fast, capturing large territories on both sides of the   border. Then, in June 2014, it declared a caliphate    a state, governed by an Islamic leader. Its territory includes oil fields, which give the group a major source of income.  Energy expert Luay   said that at the height of ISIS power, the oil was finding its way to the black market and could have been making ISIS up to $3 million each day. But ISIS has been pushed back on many fronts, losing 12% of its territory in in 2016, according to one expert estimate. Does that mean ISIS is becoming less dangerous?  Probably not. Outside of the territory it controls in the Middle East, ISIS both directs and inspires acts of terrorism around the world.  More than 2, 000 people have been killed in those attacks, which have occurred in at least 29 countries outside of Iraq and Syria, according to CNN calculations.  And what exactly is this group’s name?  They want to be known as the Islamic State, but no government in the world recognizes them as a state, and many Muslims are appalled by their definition of Islam. ISIS stands for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ISIL means basically the same thing   the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.  There is another name that the group rejects, but which many officials use: Daesh.  It’s an Arabic acronym that means the same thing as ISIL, but sounds like an Arabic word meaning ”stomp on.” And ISIS hates it so much they have threatened to cut out the tongue of anyone who uses it.', 'Thomas Pyle, President of the Institute for Energy Research spoke with Breitbart News Daily host Joel Pollak on Friday regarding President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. [There was “a lot in this deal that was bad for America,” said Pyle, adding that his group was very appreciative of Trump’s actions and “This will go down as one of the   important decisions President Trump has made. ”  Pyle emphasized that the main problem with the agreement, along with being a huge transfer of wealth, mainly to big business and the already wealthy, is that it put the government in control of the development of new energy resources, as opposed to the free market. “The biggest tragedy in all of this is the Obama administration spent billions and billions of our taxpayer money subsidizing, picking sources of energy and making bets of specific sources of energy. There’s a role for the federal government, it ought to be in basic R and D, funding those types of things that could lead to those breakthroughs. And then let the Bill Gates’s of the world, let the investor class, the people who have the resources to place bets on some of these technologies. ” “The biggest tragedy in all of this,” he said, “is the Obama administration spent billions and billions of our taxpayer money subsidizing, picking sources of energy and making bets of specific sources of energy.

Monday on CNN’s “New Day,” Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, fielded questions about Sen. Jeff Sessions’ ( ) appointment by   Donald Trump to the attorney general post.  Cuomo suggested there could be problems with Sessions’ confirmation. Conway offered a number of reasons for critics not to be concerned about Sessions and despite Cuomo’s protestations insisted much of the pushback is a result of those not willing to accept the presidential election results and are acting as if they are still in campaign mode. Partial transcript as follows: CUOMO: Let’s talk about some of these choices  —   Jeff Sessions as AG. What do you believe or anticipate the problems with confirmation to be because of his history that’s going to be a big concern. CONWAY: Let’s talk about his history. He was the Attorney General of Alabama. Before that he was the U. S. Attorney. He made sure one of the Klansman’s son who murdered an   man got the death penalty. He pushed for that. It was the first time a white man was given the death penalty for killing an   man since 1913. He voted to honor Rosa Parks. He voted to confirm one of his predecessors, former Attorney General Eric Holder, also   and President Obama’s pick. A lot of Democrats are saying now, “I don’t like his politics, so I’m not going to vote for him. ” Yet he did. He respected President Obama’s right to appoint Eric Holder. Just happens to be  . CUOMO: You’re leaving some facts out thought, right. CONWAY: No, no. CUOMO: He got denied a judgeship in 1986. Was there a reason for that? CONWAY: Yes. People like Arlen Specter who denied later said I shouldn’t have denied it and said I served with him and found for him to be egalitarian. CUOMO: Wouldn’t it be easier for him to come out and say, this stuff about me about joking about the KKK  —   CONWAY: He has said that. CUOMO:  —   that’s nonsense. I believe the NAACP is a good organization. I believe the Voting Rights Act is an important law as the attorney general to enforce  —   CONWAY: He voted got all types of civil rights extensions. CUOMO: He has been actively against that act for a long time. CONWAY: You have to look at the full measure of the man. And I know people who don’t want to respect the election results whoever they are out there  —   CUOMO: I think that’s an excuse, Kellyanne. CONWAY:  —   are still in campaign mode. They’re still in campaign mode. CUOMO: Attorney general, your choice, he’s actively against the vote. CONWAY: Why didn’t Democrats put anybody up against him last time he ran in 2014? CUOMO: In Alabama? CONWAY: Sure. If you’re against him, be the sacrificial lamb. Say I’m going to stop this guy because of who he is. They couldn’t do it because hey’re looking at the full record. He’s been the United States senator for 20 years He was a law enforcement officer before that. He is incredibly qualified. Look, the criteria for any of these posts, Chris  —   number one, are you qualified and capable of doing the job on day one? Secondly, are you loyal to the agenda that the   has put forward as his vision? And he has a right to go ahead and implement that with the advisers that he surrounds himself with. That’s what confirmation hearings are for. And I would hope someone would extend senatorial courtesy to someone they worked with and who they know in fullness. There are some pundits out there saying his name should be rescinded because they have no place in saying  —   CUOMO: That’s an opinion. I’m just asking about the facts of their service.

With a few notable exceptions, biographies,   textbooks, obituaries, and even public memory have dwelled little   on George W. Bush’s inaction in Darfur, Bill Clinton’s   floundering over Rwanda, George H. W. Bush’s dithering about   Bosnia, Jimmy Carter’s fecklessness in Cambodia, Gerald Ford’s   cold realism toward East Timor, or Richard Nixon’s complicity in   Bangladesh. “ ’ ’   Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the   Armenians?” Hitler reportedly said in 1939, predicting that the   world’s amnesia about the Turks’ mass killings should allow his   armies to proceed in all ruthlessness without fear of judgment.   We might think of those words in considering how little attention   in our history books is given to our presidents’ very limited   roles in standing up to atrocities overseas. ’ ’   And yet now, as Obama’s presidency winds down, and a ceasefire   begins to take effect Syria that Washington played no role in   negotiating, it’s becoming clear that the loss of life and   the humanitarian crisis represent just the first of many   consequences that historians will have to assess as they ask how   the United States, under Obama’s leadership, chose to deal, or   not to deal, with the Syrian Civil War. And if historians tend to   give presidents a pass on failing to arrest slaughter, they are   not so generous in evaluating the loss of American influence   around the world. ’ ’   Right now, the apparent loss of that influence seems to loom   newly large. The brutal   assault in December   crushed the Syrian resistance in its main holdout city, Aleppo,   calling into question whether the rebel forces will still be able   to carry on any insurrection at all. ’ ’   President Bashar   is gathering with the despots of   Russia, Turkey, and Iran to draw up the terms of resolution,   pointedly excluding the United States and the United Nations.   Vladimir Putin seems high in his saddle. ’ ’  ’ ’   For years, Obama has insisted that Syria isn’t of great strategic   importance to the United States. But that judgment represents not   just a break from decades of geostrategic thinking but a gamble   of considerable risk. If Obama is wrong, his miscalculation could   have massive implications. Should Russia displace the United   States as the region’s preeminent great power, it will affect   America’s access to energy, its ability to fight terrorism, its   capacity to ensure Israel’s survival, and its relationship with   states like Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. ’ ’   Equally important are the implications of Obama’s Syria policy on   Europe’s immigration crisis. For decades the continent has   struggled, with mixed results, to assimilate Muslim arrivals from   the Middle East and Africa, many of whom come bearing sharply   alien cultural values. ’ ’   But the new waves of Syrian refugees unleashed by the failure to   contain the civil war there has now created a crisis of   unparalleled magnitude. Countries from Turkey and Hungary to   Germany and France have been thrown into turmoil. Cultural   tensions escalated, empowering   nationalist parties   across the continent and contributing to Britain’s vote to leave   the European Union. ’ ’   In the United States this past year, Donald Trump amplified his   own pandering to   sentiment with new worries about an   influx of Syrian refugees  —   stoking   fears. Around   the world, it seems, the rise of noxious populist currents can be   traced, at least in part, to the deepening of the immigration   crises by the Syrian war. ’ ’  ’ ’   Yet a third result of Obama’s ineffectuality lay in the rise of   the Islamic State, a terrorist organization even more     and bent on conquest than the al Qaeda fragments   from which it sprang. Obama obviously did not create the Islamic   State, contrary to Donald Trump’s absurd   slanders.   But his administration was laggard in countering its gathering   strength. ’ ’   Although the terrorist outfit is on the defensive now, it   continues to orchestrate deadly strikes in Europe, and,   indirectly, to inspire   attacks in the United States,   guaranteeing that terrorism will remain a major threat on both   continents for years to come. ’ ’   Fourth, the failure to contain the Islamic State early on also   forced the United States to change its strategy in Syria. Turning   his attention from Assad, Obama now chose to direct American   military assistance mainly into the fight against the radical   Islamist group. Among other effects, this reorientation of   American policy made it much less likely  —   if not impossible  —     for Obama to deliver on his August 2011 vow that Assad must go. ’ ’  ’ ’   Fifth and finally, it wasn’t only Assad who emerged emboldened.   Fatefully, in 2012 Obama had declared that if Assad were to use   chemical weapons, he would cross a red line that would require   American military intervention. ’ ’   A year later, evidence surfaced that Assad did precisely that,   firing rockets filled with sarin gas at towns around Damascus. ’ ’   But in the face of skeptical congressional opinion at home, Obama   backed down from reprisals. Instead he settled for a Russian   proposal that Syria merely dismantle its weapons stockpiles, but   face no punishment for its war crimes. ’ ’   Obama has made clear that he disdains the concept of   “credibility”  —   the idea that the U. S. must follow through on its   commitments lest it get pushed around in the future. But the   reversal of policy in September 2013 on a clearly articulated   principle sent shivers from Seoul to Jerusalem to Tallinn  —   and   may well have encouraged America’s adversaries, including Russia,   to test Obama further. ’ ’   Putin’s illegal 2014 seizure of Crimea and the ongoing fomenting   of unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine were worrisome enough.   But now evidence suggests that the Russian president played a   direct role in hacking Democratic Party officials’ emails in an   effort to tip the scales of the presidential election in favor of   Trump. These disclosures have shattered any claims that Obama   showed sufficient resolve against a formidable, confident, and   completely immoral rival for geopolitical influence. ’ ’  ’ ’   How all of this will affect Obama’s reputation in the long run is   difficult to predict. Observers can only speculate, recognizing   all the while that we can’t know which elements of Obama’s policy   future historians will emphasize and which they will ignore,   which they will esteem and which they will scorn. ’ ’   Sadly, it seems probable that Obama won’t be judged too harshly   for failing to arrest the carnage in Syria. For all our fretting,   inaction in the face of genocide or mass slaughter or   humanitarian disaster has never hurt our presidents much in the   historical reckonings. ’ ’   It is true that in the wake of the Holocaust, Americans grew   conscious of the sufferings of foreign peoples and of their own   responsibility, as citizens of the world’s mightiest nation, to   try to do something. Looking at the past through this new lens,   even the sainted Franklin D. Roosevelt took a mild hit, as   historians learned more about and came to question his failure to   assist the Jewish refugees of Europe, to bomb the rail lines to   Auschwitz, or otherwise impede or retard Hitler’s killing   machine. ’ ’   More recently, historians and journalists like Samantha Power,   Ben Kiernan, and Gary J. Bass directed historians’ attention to   other genocides and mass slaughters. Human rights advocates   argued more vociferously that the world’s mightiest nations had a   duty to try to prevent such atrocities. ’ ’   But that consciousness peaked in the 1990s, and because military   interventionism has fallen out of fashion since the Iraq War, it   has been receding. Obama may have sought some solace in   the fact that presidents’ reputations have not typically   suffered for inaction in the face of mass slaughter. ’ ’  ’ ’   They do suffer, however, for frittering away American power   and prestige. Though Harry Truman wins high marks for his   handling of the communist threat in Europe, he and the Democratic   Party were haunted for years by the question, following Mao   Zedong’s civil war victory in 1949, of “Who lost China?”  —     feeding a domestic political environment that arguably made his   successors keener to intervene in Vietnam, Laos, and elsewhere in   Southeast Asia. ’ ’   Similarly, Jimmy Carter’s inability to deal effectively either   with the Soviet Union’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan or the   revolutionary Iranian government’s seizure of 52 American   hostages contributed to his defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980 as   well as to the low esteem in which his foreign policy is held by   scholars. Presidents can’t, of course, always prevent the   outbreak of conflicts and wars, but how they respond to those   wars  —   and whether the U. S. emerges from them stronger or weaker,   and the world safer or more precarious  —   is a telling measure of   leadership. ’ ’   On the other hand, as Obama knows well, presidents also suffer   for wars gone badly. Lyndon Johnson should be remembered as one   of America’s greatest presidents, but his stubborn prosecution of   the Vietnam War, despite knowing it was unwinnable, has kept him   out of the pantheon of greatness. (It’s possible that when the     Baby Boomers pass from the scene, LBJ will be   judged with greater balance and charity.) ’ ’   George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq, similarly, with all its   disastrous implications, is likely to remain the central episode   of his presidency for a long time, outranking even his more   successful response to the terrorist attacks of  . ’ ’  ’ ’   Indeed, Obama, entering office after Bush’s ruinous adventurism,   made the avoidance of another quagmire his primary goal.   Encouraged by national security aides who hailed from the realm   of domestic politics, Obama let the fear of crossing antiwar   opinion dictate his path. Yet in treading lightly, Obama   misplaced his big stick. ’ ’   A conciliator by nature, he had reached the presidency on   promises to unite inimical groups  —     and     whites and blacks  —   and in his inaugural address he likewise   pledged to bridge the gap with the Arab world. But just as he   wasn’t prepared for the implacability of congressional   Republicans, who scorned his outstretched hand in a bid to   bolster their own power, so he did not count on foreign   adversaries taking advantage of his aversion to conflict. ’ ’   Obama’s Syria legacy won’t be the only factor shaping how   posterity regards his foreign policy. The uneven efforts to wind   down the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the   Iran   nuclear deal, the opening to Cuba, the weakening of al Qaeda and   other terrorist groups, the struggles to revive peace talks   between Israel and the Palestinians  —   these add up to a mixed and   complicated record whose implications will take time and thought   to untangle. It may be that his focus on building alliances in   Asia will prove, despite the collapse of his     Partnership, to be of greater   significance than his   misadventures in Syria. ’ ’   But for now it seems hard to escape the conclusion that in   correcting for Bush’s overly aggressive foreign policy, Obama   went too far in avoiding confrontations, and that in that halting   and hesitant approach he wound up neither strengthening his   country’s influence and status nor its power to bring about its   ultimate goal of a safer and more peaceful world. ’', 'On June 16, just two days after unarmed Republican house members were attacked in Alexandria, Virginia, gun control proponent Mark Kelly pledged to fight the national reciprocity legislation that would allow congressmen to be armed for  . [Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) was left in critical condition, and four others were also wounded when the attacker opened fire during Wednesday’s congressional baseball practice. The gunman carried an “assassination” list in his pocket that contained the names of three GOP house members who were at the baseball practice.  GOP lawmakers responded to the shooting by stressing a renewed focus on national reciprocity, with some pointing out that they have concealed carry licenses but cannot keep guns with them because they have to drive into Washington D. C. which has draconian gun control laws. On Thursday, Rep. Thomas Massie ( ) sought to remedy this situation by introducing legislation that would that would force D. C. to recognize the carry permit of every state. In other words, D. C. would adopt national reciprocity. But on Friday, Kelly pledged to stop any effort to pass legislation that would allow   citizens to be armed in this fashion. Speaking to NPR, Kelly said he and his wife are fighting against “concealed carry reciprocity. ” He also vowed to fight efforts to remove “  zones in schools. ” He couched these statements amid a larger discussion of creating a “safer society. ” But the problem —  as Wednesday’s attack showed —  is that barring   citizens from having guns with them for   only makes them vulnerable. Congressional baseball practice attendee Rep. Mike Bishop ( ) said it made them “sitting ducks. ” Kelly spoke in favor of passing universal background checks, claiming that background checks lower crime. He did not point out that the Alexandria attacker acquired his firearms from a Federal Firearm License (FFL) holder, which means he passed background checks to get them. Kelly also failed to note that his wife, Gabby Giffords, was shot by a man who passed a background check to acquire his gun.

Like do you really think America’s the best democracy we’ve ever had?” asked an audience member during the QA session after Milo’s speech. “In the history of human civilization, yes” Milo replied. “But something like Scandinavian countries, maybe. Don’t you think they have a better type of democracy?” the audience member added. “People sometimes say this, and I think that Norway for instance doesn’t really have an economy  …     It doesn’t really make much sense to praise them in economic terms. But these countries are socialist” responded Milo. “These are countries where there are higher property taxes for houses that have sea views. These are countries that control every aspect of your life, and will excise you from public service and the public square if you don’t prescribe to a narrow set of allowable opinions. ” “In Sweden, the reason this country has gotten into so much trouble, the reason why Sweden has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of immigrants that it cannot cope with, is the stultifying political correctness that takes hold in socialist countries” he continued. “And the fact that if you are a Swede, and you until very very recently, and even now if you work in the arts or anywhere, if you even broached the subject of immigration, you would be castigated as a racist, fired from your job, and cast out of society. ” “It’s difficult for me, hearing people praise these supposedly wonderful Scandinavian nations, to look out on them, and to look at the narrow range of acceptable opinions, when you compare it to somewhere like America, and praise them in any way whatsoever” Milo concluded. “So I have to tell you, no. I can’t think of a better example than America of a country that is still by and large pretty free. Scandinavia is in a real mess, and it’s in a real mess precisely because its voters haven’t voted for freedom, they’ve voted for stultifying control from their governments. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

As I begin to tell my friends and family about the seven days you treated my wife, Laura Levis, in what turned out to be the last days of her young life, they stop me at about the 15th name that I recall. The list includes the doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists, social workers, even cleaning staff members who cared for her. “How do you remember any of their names?” they ask. How could I not, I respond. Every single one of you treated Laura with such professionalism, and kindness, and dignity as she lay unconscious. When she needed shots, you apologized that it was going to hurt a little, whether or not she could hear. When you listened to her heart and lungs through your stethoscopes, and her gown began to slip, you pulled it up to respectfully cover her. You spread a blanket, not only when her body temperature needed regulating, but also when the room was just a little cold, and you thought she’d sleep more comfortably that way. You cared so greatly for her parents, helping them climb into the room’s awkward recliner, fetching them fresh water almost by the hour, and by answering every one of their medical questions with incredible patience. My    a doctor himself as you learned, felt he was involved in her care. I can’t tell you how important that was to him. Then, there was how you treated me. How would I have found the strength to have made it through that week without you? How many times did you walk into the room to find me sobbing, my head down, resting on her hand, and quietly go about your task, as if willing yourselves invisible? How many times did you help me set up the recliner as close as possible to her bedside, crawling into the mess of wires and tubes around her bed in order to swing her forward just a few feet? How many times did you check in on me to see whether I needed anything, from food to drink, fresh clothes to a hot shower, or to see whether I needed a better explanation of a medical procedure, or just someone to talk to? How many times did you hug me and console me when I fell to pieces, or ask about Laura’s life and the person she was, taking the time to look at her photos or read the things I’d written about her? How many times did you deliver bad news with compassionate words, and sadness in your eyes? When I needed to use a computer for an emergency email, you made it happen. When I smuggled in a very special visitor, our tuxedo cat, Cola, for one final lick of Laura’s face, you “didn’t see a thing. ” And one special evening, you gave me full control to usher into the I. C. U. more than 50 people in Laura’s life, from friends to   to college alums to family members. It was an outpouring of love that included guitar playing and opera singing and dancing and new revelations to me about just how deeply my wife touched people. It was the last great night of our marriage together, for both of us, and it wouldn’t have happened without your support. There is another moment  —   actually, a single hour  —   that I will never forget. On the final day, as we waited for Laura’s organ donor surgery, all I wanted was to be alone with her. But family and friends kept coming to say their goodbyes, and the clock ticked away. About 4 p. m. finally, everyone had gone, and I was emotionally and physically exhausted, in need of a nap. So I asked her nurses, Donna and Jen, if they could help me set up the recliner, which was so uncomfortable, but all I had, next to Laura again. They had a better idea. They asked me to leave the room for a moment, and when I returned, they had shifted Laura to the right side of her bed, leaving just enough room for me to crawl in with her one last time. I asked if they could give us one hour without a single interruption, and they nodded, closing the curtains and the doors, and shutting off the lights. I nestled my body against hers. She looked so beautiful, and I told her so, stroking her hair and face. Pulling her gown down slightly, I kissed her breasts, and laid my head on her chest, feeling it rise and fall with each breath, her heartbeat in my ear. It was our last tender moment as a husband and a wife, and it was more natural and pure and comforting than anything I’ve ever felt. And then I fell asleep. I will remember that last hour together for the rest of my life. It was a gift beyond gifts, and I have Donna and Jen to thank for it. Really, I have all of you to thank for it.

The vicious attack happened on the second night of protests in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, where Black Lives Matter protesters are angered about the police shooting death of Alfred Olango, 38. El Cajon police say they shot and killed Olango after responding to a call from his sister that he was acting erratically. Olango refused to comply with police orders, then “assumed a shooting stance” with what appeared to be a gun, but later turned out to be a vape cigarette electronic device. Despite media reports describing the protests as “peaceful,” Wednesday night’s protest included not only the beating of a Trump supporter, but also direct confrontations with the police.

[Now, a pair of enterprising hoaxers has proved it scientifically by persuading an academic journal to   and publish their paper claiming that the penis is not really a male genital organ but a social construct.  The paper, published by Cogent Social Sciences  —   “a multidisciplinary open access journal offering high quality peer review across the social sciences”  —   also claims that penises are responsible for causing climate change. The two hoaxers are Peter Boghossian, a   faculty member in the Philosophy department at Portland State University, and James Lindsay, who has a doctorate in math and a background in physics. They were hoping to emulate probably the most famous academic hoax in recent years: the Sokal Hoax  —   named after NYU and UCL physics professor Alan Sokal  —   who in 1996 persuaded an academic journal called Social Text to accept a paper titled “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity”. Sokal’s paper  —   comprising pages of   but meaningless   jargon  —   was written in part to demonstrate that humanities journals will publish pretty much anything so long as it sounds like “proper leftist thought” and partly in order to send up the absurdity of so much   social science. So, for this new spoof, Boghossian and Lindsay were careful to throw in lots of signifier phrases to indicate fashionable   bias: We intended to test the hypothesis that flattery of the academic Left’s moral architecture in general, and of the moral orthodoxy in gender studies in particular, is the overwhelming determiner of publication in an academic journal in the field. That is, we sought to demonstrate that a desire for a certain moral view of the world to be validated could overcome the critical assessment required for legitimate scholarship. Particularly, we suspected that gender studies is crippled academically by an overriding   belief that maleness is the root of all evil. On the evidence, our suspicion was justified. They also took care to make it completely incomprehensible. We didn’t try to make the paper coherent instead, we stuffed it full of jargon (like “discursive” and “isomorphism”) nonsense (like arguing that hypermasculine men are both inside and outside of certain discourses at the same time)   phrases (like “   society”) lewd references to slang terms for the penis, insulting phrasing regarding men (including referring to some men who choose not to have children as being “unable to coerce a mate”) and allusions to rape (we stated that “manspreading,” a complaint levied against men for sitting with their legs spread wide, is “akin to raping the empty space around him”). After completing the paper, we read it carefully to ensure it didn’t say anything meaningful, and as neither one of us could determine what it is actually about, we deemed it a success. Some of it was written with the help of the Postmodern Generator  —   “a website coded in the 1990s by Andrew Bulhak featuring an algorithm, based on NYU physicist Alan Sokal’s method of hoaxing a cultural studies journal called Social Text, that returns a different fake postmodern ‘paper’ every time the page is reloaded. ” This paragraph, for example, looks impressive but is literally meaningless: Inasmuch as masculinity is essentially performative, so too is the conceptual penis. The penis, in the words of Judith Butler, “can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility” (Butler, 1993). The penis should not be understood as an honest expression of the performer’s intent should it be presented in a performance of masculinity or hypermasculinity. Thus, the isomorphism between the conceptual penis and what’s referred to throughout discursive feminist literature as “toxic hypermasculinity,” is one defined upon a vector of male cultural machismo braggadocio, with the conceptual penis playing the roles of subject, object, and verb of action. The result of this trichotomy of roles is to place hypermasculine men both within and outside of competing discourses whose dynamics, as seen via   discourse analysis, enact a systematic interplay of power in which hypermasculine men use the conceptual penis to move themselves from powerless subject positions to powerful ones (confer: Foucault, 1972). None of it should have survived more than a moment’s scrutiny by serious academics. But it was   by two experts in the field who, after suggesting only a few changes, passed it for publication: Cogent Social Sciences eventually accepted “The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct. ” The reviewers were amazingly encouraging, giving us very high marks in nearly every category. For example, one reviewer graded our thesis statement “sound” and praised it thusly, “It capturs [sic] the issue of hypermasculinity through a   and nonlinear process” (which we take to mean that it wanders aimlessly through many layers of jargon and nonsense). The other reviewer marked the thesis, along with the entire paper, “outstanding” in every applicable category. They didn’t accept the paper outright, however. Cogent Social Sciences’ Reviewer #2 offered us a few relatively easy fixes to make our paper “better. ” We effortlessly completed them in about two hours, putting in a little more nonsense about “manspreading” (which we alleged to be a cause of climate change) and “  contests. ” No claim made in the paper was considered too ludicrous by the  : not even the one claiming that the penis is “the universal performative source of rape, and is the conceptual driver behind much of climate change. ” You read that right. We argued that climate change is “conceptually” caused by penises. How do we defend that assertion? Like this: Destructive, unsustainable hegemonically male approaches to pressing environmental policy and action are the predictable results of a raping of nature by a   mindset. This mindset is best captured by recognizing the role of [sic] the conceptual penis holds over masculine psychology. When it is applied to our natural environment, especially virgin environments that can be cheaply despoiled for their material resources and left dilapidated and diminished when our patriarchal approaches to economic gain have stolen their inherent worth, the extrapolation of the rape culture inherent in the conceptual penis becomes clear. The fact that such complete drivel was published in a social science journal, the hoaxers argue, raises serious questions about the value of fields like gender studies and the state of academic publishing generally: “The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct” should not have been published on its merits because it was actively written to avoid having any merits whatsoever. The paper is academically worthless nonsense. But they do not hold out much hope for it having any more effect on the bullshit in the social sciences industry than Sokal’s hoax did  —   because leftist stupidity in academe is so heavily entrenched. As a matter of deeper concern, there is unfortunately some reason to believe that our hoax will not break the relevant spell. First, Alan Sokal’s hoax, now more than 20 years old, did not prevent the continuation of bizarre postmodernist “scholarship. ” In particular, it did not lead to a general tightening of standards that would have blocked our own hoax. Second, people rarely give up on their moral attachments and ideological commitments just because they’re shown to be out of alignment with reality.', 'President Trump says that the United States’ persistent trade deficit is a scourge that must be eliminated. But new data Tuesday shows the complexity of the costs and benefits of trade  —   and how reducing the trade deficit, if not done right, could leave Americans worse off. What really matters is not whether the trade deficit is rising or falling. What matters is why. The trade deficit rose 9. 6 percent in January, to the highest level since 2012 (though it remains lower as a share of the total economy). It’s in the details of that $48. 5 billion gap between what the United States exported and what it imported, though, that you see why the economy is more complex than the “trade deficits are bad” framing of the Trump administration. Picking apart the January numbers, you see just how that way of looking at trade can be misleading. The challenge for the Trump administration, if it sticks to its guns of reducing the trade deficit as a top economic goal, will be to do so by focusing on what really matters for Americans’ standards of living. The trade deficit fell a great deal during the 2008 recession, for example. No one would argue it made Americans (or pretty much anyone else) better off. The United States actually exported 0. 9 percent more goods in January than it did in December (the numbers are adjusted for the usual seasonal variations). If your concern is that other countries haven’t been buying enough goods made in U. S. factories, the January numbers pointed in a positive direction. The United States exported $1. 3 billion more in automobiles and $2. 1 billion more in industrial supplies in January than it did in December. The details show the economic idea of specialization at work. The $1. 3 billion rise in automotive exports was paired with a $900 million rise in automotive imports. The overall balance didn’t shift much, but that suggests that the United States is shipping cars and trucks that it makes more efficiently while importing those that others make more efficiently. The reason the trade deficit rose is that imports rose faster than exports. But even that isn’t entirely a negative. Imports of consumer goods rose by $2. 4 billion in January, with a particularly strong rise in imported cellphones. That reflects the relative strength of the U. S. economy. American consumers have rising incomes, and inevitably they spend part of that income on imported goods. In effect, the higher trade deficit in January is in significant part caused by U. S. economic strength. It is the inverse of what happened during the 2008 recession. Buying more imported consumer goods because you are making more money is generally a good thing, not a bad thing. Some exports of products were down in a few sectors where the United States has important competitive advantages. Exports of civilian aircraft  —   think Boeing jets sold across the globe  —   fell by $611 million, and shipments of other   capital goods like aircraft engines and telecommunications equipment were also down. Such sectors tend to be volatile, so these may turn out to be blips. But if global demand softened for these products made by skilled workers with advanced technology, it would be bad news for Americans. Meanwhile, a persistent strength of the U. S. economy has been in services, but the balance of trade in services worsened by $5. 3 billion. This may reflect a rise in the value of the dollar. For example, when travelers from abroad visit the United States and spend money at hotels and restaurants, that counts as a services export. That number fell by $89 million in January. It is worth watching whether that falls further, as it might should the dollar keep rising and should the Trump administration’s ban on travel from several countries dissuade   travelers. Given the vast numbers of American jobs tied to service industries, it would be bad news if that trend continued. A big piece in the rise in imports was crude oil and other petroleum products. They were up by a combined $2. 2 billion. (Exports of those products also rose, by $1. 2 billion, but combined that means oil contributed to the widening of the trade deficit.) But that seems less worrisome if you know that the price of crude oil rose 9 percent from the start of December until the start of January. A rise in the price of oil or any other commodity benefits its producers and costs its consumers. It will affect, over time, patterns of imports and exports of that product. But when the trade deficit rises or falls because of those shifts, it’s not really because of trade per se, but because of underlying shifts in supply and demand for the commodity in question. Put it all together, and while the January trade report has some weak spots and areas for concern, it is not nearly the unabashed bad news that a simplistic reading of the trade deficit would suggest. If the trade deficit falls during the Trump administration because sales of   automobiles, jet airliners or services overseas boom, that will be great news. If it falls because Americans’ spending collapses, it will be bad news. If it falls because of commodity price swings, it will depend on which commodities exactly, and where they’re made. The trade deficit is important. But using it as a simplistic scorecard doesn’t tell the full story.', 'Wednesday on WABC Radio’s “Election Central with Rita Cosby,” Sen.

Obama is seen in by the region in the Mid East as being an unreliable partner. I think the entire world is going to look at Donald Trump as guy who doesn’t understand the role of America. ” He continued, “This speech was unnerving, it was pathetic in its content, and it was scary in terms of its construct.

Russell and his muse,   Jennifer Lawrence. It is also, far and away, their best. As much as I enjoyed “Silver Linings Playbook” ( 2012) and “American Hustle (2013) I have no desire to see either again.  The opposite is true for “Joy,” which succeeds both as a love letter to the endless possibilities one can achieve through American capitalism and a   story that manages to make its point without laying down a lecture.  Joy Mangano (a terrific Lawrence) is a divorced mother of two eking out a living in Long Island (circa 1990) as a booking clerk for Eastern Airlines. Other than her supportive grandmother (Diane Ladd) Joy somehow manages to survive among and live with an extended family that is equal parts eccentric and   selfish. Joy’s   of two years is a   lounge singer who lives in her basement. Her divorced mother (Virginia Madsen) is a bedridden   addicted to a cheesy television soap opera. Her father (Robert DeNiro) the only one who chips in economically, is a needy emotional mess constantly moving from one girlfriend to another, and living with Joy   romantic conquests.  If this sounds like the latest overrated piece of quirky twee garbage from Wes Anderson, let me stop you right there. What grounds the story, and makes all of this illuminating and charming, is Joy’s grounded normalcy. Like Marty McFly in “Back to the Future” and Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” Joy is the (sometimes) calm, sympathetic, and relatable center of the storm. Joy is also a young woman with dreams stunted by her own bad choices and a family that confuses love with pecking her to death, a young woman constantly put upon in ways big and small and one who intuitively understands she was meant for bigger things, that time is quickly running out, and when it does, a tragically misspent life will be her epitaph.

As is often the case in the complicated, competitive, and oftentimes unscrupulous American business world, the   success of this invention delivers only heartbreak, disillusionment, and bankruptcy.  At first Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) appears to be Joy’s White Knight. The QVC executive gives Joy her first big break on his home shopping cable channel. Wisely, though, the story doesn’t take this easy route. Walker is honest and decent, but he is no  . To his credit, knowing that in the end it will do nobody, especially Joy, any good to engage in Little   action, he throws her in the deep end and walks away. Russell is obviously telling a female empowerment story here, but it is the exact right kind. Men are not demonized (Joy’s relationship with   is my favorite subplot) they also do not Make Her Dreams Come True. With the help of men and women who show some faith in her, Joy reaches previously unimagined heights, and does so in the best way: all on her own. No trigger warnings. No government help. This is why “Joy” is also a love letter to American capitalism, and a realistic one that doesn’t disguise the endless struggle required to achieve success, doesn’t paper over the harsh reality that life indeed is not fair, in fact it is frequently unjust. At the same time, “Joy” says declaratively that although the playing field is brutal and unforgiving, America is still a uniquely extraordinary place where, if you have the drive and the brains and the guts and are willing to repeatedly pick yourself up off the floor of failure, nobodies can become anybody. Joy doesn’t sleep around or ask for handouts or assume she’s entitled, and she’s a devoted mother who digs firing a shotgun. What more can you ask for in a role model, especially for young women? “Joy” is not only a wonderful movie, each scene is its own perfect little short film.

This remote mountain town in British Columbia has recently welcomed a new wave of settlers: urban refugees, increasingly priced out of cities like Vancouver and yearning for a simpler life. They are drawn to a   burg that seems to have it all  —   a music academy, two video stores, three record shops, a charcuterie owned by actual French people and a main street unmarred by a Starbucks or   chains. Many of Nelson’s recent transplants fled Canadian cities, where even a couple in cubicle professions can struggle to get by. Others were willing to exchange lucrative salaries for jobs that let them go mountain biking in the afternoon. “Nobody moves here to work their butt off,” said Amy Bohigian, 43, a   filmmaker who relocated with her wife to Nelson from Toronto in 2006. To stay, however, they had to adapt to the town’s rather quirky entrepreneurial skill set. “You may have to sell   soap at the craft market for the first few years until your massage practice has enough clients,” she said, only half joking. But Nelson’s charms have become something of a curse. The recent influx of people to this compact town of 10, 000 has led to an affordable housing crisis, set off by bidding wars over its scarce housing stock and a zero percent rental vacancy rate caused in part by homeowners who rent their properties to tourists through sites like Airbnb. Nelson’s homeless shelter has been full for months, and some residents, unable to find a place to rent, spent the spring and summer living in tents or trailers in the town’s campground. The local community college lost around 60 students this year because they could not find housing, officials said. Nelson’s housing crisis echoes a wider problem in booming British Columbia, where tight real estate markets, diminished government support for affordable housing and rising inflation have spawned a vacancy rate of 1. 3 percent, and made rentals virtually impossible to find in Vancouver, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. But Nelson is no metropolis. Founded during a silver rush in 1897, the town is wedged between a lake and the steep slopes of the Selkirk Mountains, some 400 miles east of Vancouver by road. Around a century ago, a sect of Christian Pacifists from Russia, known as the Dukhobors, settled nearby, infusing the region with antiwar zeal. During the Vietnam War, Nelson became a haven for young Americans fleeing the draft, many of whom were spirited across the border by members of a local Quaker community. In the 1970s, Nelson and the surrounding Slocan Valley were abundant with draft dodgers, hippie communes and “the best weed in the world,” said Mike Hames, 68, a Canadian carpenter whose zany,   house, resembling “a boat on a mushroom trip,” is a local landmark. Nelson lost its sawmill and university a decade later, forcing the struggling town to reinvent itself through tourism and entrepreneurship. “Marijuana was definitely how people made money,” said Deb Kozak, the mayor. Nelson’s liberal tolerance played a major role in making it a regional hub for social service providers. But they have been overwhelmed by a swelling population and rising poverty. “It’s a perfect storm of   issues,” said Jenny Robinson, executive director of the Nelson Cares Society, which runs the town’s   homeless shelter and provides services to   residents. The group has received funding and donations to maintain and build some new accommodations, she said, but not enough to solve the town’s extreme housing crunch. “In the last 18 months it’s just gone crazy,” Ms. Robinson said. Janet Mulloy and her twin, Judy, both artists, were free spirits when they moved to Nelson in 1984. Until a decade ago, Judy said, they were able to afford an apartment for under $800 a month, scraped together from their small jewelry business, odd jobs and public assistance. But Nelson’s housing crisis pushed them into homelessness this year. “This is the first time we’ve lived apart in over 20 years,” said Janet, 51, who had been sleeping in the shelter for a month while her sister moved in with a friend. The misery of homelessness has compounded a sense that the Nelson they once knew was disappearing. “It’s an economic cleansing of this town we helped create,” Judy said with a sigh. Baker Street, Nelson’s main drag, is a testament to the tensions roiling the community. On a recent afternoon, a   busker stood strumming a Tom Petty tune in front of a cafe that sells organic coffee. Beggars with swollen hands suggesting heroin addiction panhandled outside a boutique selling hemp yoga pants, beeswax candles and posters explaining “How to Be an Ally to Indigenous Peoples. ” Balancing Nelson’s economic future and cultural heritage is complicated by the town’s cramped mountainside locale. “Geographically we can’t do sprawl,” Mayor Kozak said. Still, she said that Nelson was working to develop a “full spectrum” of housing to ease the crisis, while trying to address the concerns of residents worried that new development will ruin their counterculture paradise. The community once thwarted the construction of a Walmart superstore, but officials have since installed broadband internet and hope to approve a tech innovation center, part of a plan to stem rural brain drain. New arrivals are not complaining. Adam Thomas, 42, who moved to Nelson in July with his family after selling their Vancouver home, said that even dual incomes there were no longer enough to keep them out of debt. “We felt trapped in Vancouver,” he said, seated by the fire in the   house they purchased for $250, 000. “We’re lucky. I feel like I’ve got to earn the right to be here. ” His wife found an office job and he dived into the town’s communal economy, teaching at the local college and working at the   radio station. On Take Your Daughter to Work Day, Mr. Thomas took his daughter to his shift at Reo’s Video store, a bustling rental throwback bought and expanded this year by another Vancouver transplant. It is stocked with about 15, 000 films, a foreign section and every Academy Award best picture winner. “It’s like living in the 1990s,” he said.', ' (CNN) The National Park Service will drain the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool this weekend after approximately 80 ducklings were found dead, including 53 in one day.  The culprit is a parasite that grows in snails that live in the pool, said park service spokesman Mike Litterst. The federal agency says chemical treatments alone aren’t sufficient to fully reduce the parasite and snail population. So the pool must be drained and cleaned. The cleanup begins Sunday. It will take about two days to fully drain the water. On Tuesday, crews will begin cleaning the interior.  Humans who come in contact with the parasite could develop cercarial dermatitis, better known as ”swimmer’s itch.” It’s not  contagious and rarely requires medical treatment, but it’s uncomfortable. Crews will refill the pool next Friday and things should be back to normal the following week. ', 'Ain’t you glad, Little Milton sang, that things don’t talk? Especially our bodies. In the 1960s and ’70s Reader’s Digest printed a series of   essays with titles like “I Am Joe’s Lung. ” These were popular, and weird. In “I Am Joe’s Heart,” this vital organ emoted like a stereotypically aggrieved Jewish mother. “When Joe thinks of me at all, he thinks of me as fragile and delicate. Delicate! When so far in his life I have pumped more than 300, 000 tons of blood?” Some of our organs, this time of year, are beyond speech. Recall the headline in The Onion, the satirical magazine, about a   country singer: “Liver Flees George Jones’ Body. ” James Hamblin’s first book is titled “If Our Bodies Could Talk: A Guide to Operating and Maintaining a Human Body. ” He’s a graduate of Indiana University’s medical school and a senior editor at The Atlantic. His book began its life as an online video series, also called “If Our Bodies Could Talk. ” His   segments are like “The Dr. Oz Show,” if “The Dr. Oz Show” were produced by   quirky interns from public radio’s “This American Life. ” Sadly there are no talking spleens or thyroids or wombs in Mr. Hamblin’s book. Sadly too there is little identifiable soul in it. Its cardinal humors are wan. “If Our Bodies Could Talk” is a numbingly upbeat grab bag of anecdotes and factoids and curiosities with no  . As your literary M. D. I cannot recommend it, except in the tiniest doses. To sit by its bedside for very long is to watch a patient expire. The strangling thing about “If Our Bodies Could Talk” is that someone has told Mr. Hamblin that he’s funny  —   there’s an attempt at a joke in almost every other paragraph  —   but he isn’t actually so, at least not on the page. You recognize his jokes as “humor,” but they don’t make you smile. A typical formulation: “Adrenaline is the hormone that’s meant to be released when we are under stress and need energy, say, to outrun a bear or lift a fallen boulder off our climbing partner. (He’s probably not alive anymore, but it’s worth checking. )” Not abysmal, you might think. But over the course of a long book these pokes in the ribs are monstrously wearing. They’re like having a pebble in your ski boot partway down a long slope, or a lash you can’t remove from your eye. Mr. Hamblin is at his best in “If Our Bodies Could Talk” on those rare occasions when he drops his dementedly amiable tone. Once in a while he goes on the attack against greed and waste and stupidity in health matters, and things pick up. “What is gluten?” “What makes hair curl?” “Do I need eight glasses of water a day?” “Why do males have nipples?” This is the sort of trampled ground that Mr. Hamblin’s book mostly covers. He maintains an interest in offbeat diseases, such as one that makes some people scratch constantly and one that causes the human skin to easily rub off. He dispenses offbeat facts as if they were canapés on a tray. “The average person has about six pounds of skin. ” “People with tattoos are six times more likely to have hepatitis C. ” “We produce 1. 5 liters of saliva a day. ” Then he turns to address the charlatans in the supplements industry, and his blood finally begins to simmer. Suddenly your eyeballs don’t have to be forced to remain on the page. He takes aim at a   1994 law called DSHEA (the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act) that prevents almost any regulation or safety testing of supplements. Supplements, he writes, is “a meaningless word that refers to nothing so much as a parallel pharmaceutical industry  —   one that has accomplished the spectacular feat of selling billions of dollars’ worth of most anything it likes, in almost any way it chooses, promising people anything conceivable about their bodies. ” You read this patriotic and   riff and realize that, in the bizarro world we occupy, it can’t be long before Lance Armstrong and Barry Bonds are named   of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Hamblin is just as good on drinks marketed under names like Smartwater and Vitaminwater and Fruitwater and Electrolyte Water. He quotes a doctor who tells him about Electrolyte Water, which is sold at Whole Foods, “The city water in Philadelphia has more electrolytes. ” (The city water in Philadelphia is notoriously mediocre. In her 1974 novel, “Oreo,” the novelist Fran Ross reminded us that it has long been called, after one of the city’s rivers, Schuylkill Punch.) It’s typical of Mr. Hamblin to step on his riff on dubious water products with a joke that’s D. O. A.: “Don’t drink the Oil Water. It’s for cars. ” We have a   relationship with medical knowledge. It’s so interesting and so terrible. Lucia Berlin, in her brilliant collection of stories, “A Manual for Cleaning Women” (2015) wrote about a nurse who considered the nature of clear colostomy bags and thought: “What if our bodies were transparent, like a washing machine window? How wondrous to watch ourselves. Joggers would jog even harder, blood pumping away. Lovers would love more. God damn! Look at that semen go! Diets would improve. ” Like Little Milton, I’d guess, I’m glad we don’t have that either.', 'On Friday’s broadcast of “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that especially with Israel and Russia   Donald Trump is “siding with a foreign leader against the US president. ”  Brooks said, “What’s sort of remarkable is that, especially in the Israel and the Russia cases, you’ve got a US citizen, Donald Trump, siding with a foreign leader against the US president. There is a reason why   have tried to remain mute during their transitional periods, relatively, because you just don’t want to be for somebody  —   some other country against your own government, and especially when you’re about to take the helm of that government. And there will be a lot of permanent people who are just going to be stuck there, who’s  —   who are now in a war between the   and the guy they’re currently serving. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett', 'WASHINGTON —  Tuesday, the Supreme Court will begin its first sitting in which the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will reflect the views and priorities of President Donald Trump, inaugurating a new direction in American law. [The Supreme Court hears roughly 80 cases per year, divided into seven monthly sittings. The annual term begins with its first sitting on the first Monday in October, and the last sitting for each annual term is conducted over two weeks in April.  The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) represents the United States before the U. S. Supreme Court. The office is led by a solicitor general (SG) who is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, assisted by a principal deputy solicitor general who is a presidential appointment not subject to Senate confirmation. These two appointees oversee a team of close to twenty attorneys who are mostly career staff, the senior ones holding the rank of deputy solicitor general, and the junior members being called assistant to the solicitor general. Together, they constitute one of the finest appellate legal teams in the nation. President Trump has not yet nominated an SG but has already named a deputy, Noel Francisco, as the   at OSG. Francisco is a Supreme Court rock star, a former clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia and former partner at powerhouse firm Jones Day who has argued a number of major cases before the justices. Francisco has control over OSG until such time as Trump’s pick for the top spot is chosen and confirmed, which might not occur for another couple months. Although OSG has already filed its legal briefs for most of the year’s remaining Supreme Court cases, changes or updates can be made during oral argument or with certain supplemental filings, so the Trump DOJ can make the new president’s views known as the justices tackle a number of issues involving the federal government. This Tuesday, the Court will hear arguments in Hernandez v. Mesa, a case in which a Mexican teenager on the Mexican side of the U. S.  border was fatally shot by a U. S. Border Patrol agent on the U. S. side of the border. The teenager’s family said he was playing pranks by touching the Mexico side of the border barrier, while DOJ insists that the young man was part of a group of teenagers throwing large rocks at the agent, posing a serious risk to the officer’s safety and disregarding repeated warnings to drop the rocks and back away. DOJ will be represented by Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, a career veteran at OSG who has argued more than 100 times before the High Court, representing both Republican and Democrat presidents. The second case on Tuesday will be McLane v. EEOC. The private litigant is represented by Dallas attorney Allyson Ho, a partner at Morgan Lewis  Bockius, who, like Francisco, is a favorite among conservatives and an accomplished Supreme Court litigator who previously clerked for a Supreme Court justice. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will be presented by an assistant to the solicitor general, Rachel Kovner. The makeup of the nation’s highest court is also changing. One of its nine seats has been vacant since the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But President Trump’s nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, appears unstoppable for confirmation, and is expected to join the Court this April. Between new lawyers leading OSG and new justices joining the nation’s highest court, February 2017 marks the beginning of a new trend in the legal arguments and decisions at the Supreme Court, a trend that will continue for at least the next four years.

[Stated Mason:  “What Trump ever did to women is that he called them a name because she gained too much weight so he said she got too fat and he called her a pig. Imagine if the worst thing Bill Clinton ever did was call a girl a name. He called them names after he raped them. ” “When he got through with them, Juanita Broaddrick wound up with a cut lip.

[Here’s his latest smear job:  Is there anyone in this Administration who did not have contact with the Russians? #Trumprussia,  —   Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) March 2, 2017,  In the late 1990s and early 2000s Farallon was involved in illicit attempts to capitalize on the economic liberalization of the former Soviet Union country. The U. S. Agency of International Development (USAID) formed an agreement with Harvard University’s Institute of International Development (HIID) in the   to guide the former Soviet Union country towards a market economy. Harvard economist Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay, a top HIID advisor, were the two officials charged with spearheading the project. Shleifer and Hay advised the Russian government on the privatization of more than 200, 000 corporations, the issuance of government debt, and the construction of financial institutions to integrate the nation into the global economy. The two HIID officials were privy to vast inside knowledge of the restructuring of the Russian economy. The U. S. government would later charge them both with using that knowledge to enrich themselves, in violation of USAID    agreements. Harvard would eventually shutter the HIID following the scandal. Farallon provided the investment vehicle for a number of those schemes and was also the target of legal action by the U. S. government for its role. Steyer’s subsequent embrace of all things environmental is widely seen by those familiar with his modus operandi as a way of cynically greenwashing his murky fossil fuel past, while simultaneously leaping aboard the lucrative “clean energy” gravy train. It also happens to align with the interests of his Russian pals. Russia is a petro economy highly reliant on its oil and gas revenues. As we learned from Wikileak documents of secret meetings held by Hillary Clinton,   businesses have reportedly funneled millions to   organisations in the US in order to protect its business interests. A U. S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee report in 2014 exposed the Sea Change Foundation for its major funding from Klein Ltd, a   shell corporation run by executives with strong ties to longtime Putin friend Leonid Reiman, Russia’s   oil giant Rosneft and Russian energy investment groups including Firebird New Russia Fund and Vimpelcom Ltd. Klein Ltd. has reportedly funneled $23 million to Sea Change. In the period 1997 to 2015, Sea Change donated more than $64. 8 million to the Energy Foundation, a “ ” financing organization to which Steyer’s Tomkat Charitable Trust donated $4, 150, 000. Th Energy Foundation has disbursed to other   groups, including the Blue Green Alliance Foundation, Environmental Defense Fund, the Rockefeller Family Fund and many others.  If Tom Steyer really now feels so very strongly about the evils of the Russians, maybe he should consider giving away the $1. 5 billion fortune he made from sucking up to them. This post has been updated since publication. CORRECTION: A previous version of the article incorrectly stated “Klein Ltd. in 2011 funneled more than $43 million to   groups. ” ', ' (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign has always been about Trump. It hasn’t been about the party and it hasn’t really been about policy. It’s been about the man himself. And for many months, it seemed that there was ample room in the GOP, and even in broader parts of the electorate, for his renegade style. But in recent weeks, the value of the Trump brand has been plummeting, especially since the release of the ”Access Hollywood” tape. Polls show that the distance between Hillary Clinton and Trump is growing. Congressional Republicans are seriously worried about the possibility of Democrats retaking control of the Senate and possibly the House. Trump’s campaign theme seems to have switched from ”Make America Great Again” to ”I’m a victim.” The New York Times reported that several major donors are urging the Republican National Committee to separate themselves from the Republican nominee for fear the party will suffer irreversible damage. Trump delivered a conspiratorial    and, some thought, borderline      speech in Palm Beach: ”Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plan the destruction of global sovereignty in order to enrich these global interest powers.” This speech, combined with his   attacks on Bill Clinton’s sexual past, have led many to conclude that his campaign is literally spinning out of control. Clinton is thriving in what might be called the ” ” strategy of just letting Trump be Trump. This was captured in the ”Saturday Night Live” sketch of the first presidential debate, when viewers could see Clinton on the split screen, played by the comedienne Kate McKinnon, struggling to keep a straight face as her jaw dropped listening to Trump, played by Alec Baldwin. Clinton slowly pushes her jaw back up so she can keep a straight face. There are many reasons that the Trump style is steadily losing support outside of his loyal base. Certain pillars that undergirded his success have fallen away. The insurgent appeal depended on his being someone who stood outside the mainstream political institutions. When he took on Republicans like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, he could legitimately claim that he really had very weak connections to the mainstream political establishment. That is no longer the case. Trump has thrived in the news media throughout this campaign, taking advantage of the   environment and endless desire for content. He became a political star in an oversaturated news media market that is constantly in search of a good story. He also won the nomination, gained the support of many of the party’s leaders and had the full apparatus of the GOP standing behind him. Even after the outrage over the ”Access Hollywood” tape, many Republicans walked back their threats to drop their support for him. But when he claims to be fighting an establishment in October 2016, the arguments sound more conspiratorial and like an effort by someone who is losing to find a scapegoat. Trump’s targets are real people, Trump’s attacks on immigrants, Muslims and women are not new. But after the ”Access Hollywood” tape surfaced, Trump’s comments have sounded different to independents, undecided voters, and even many Republicans as real faces and real people who have accused Trump emerged on the scene to show what he was talking about.   When historians look back at this campaign, one of the key turning points will undoubtedly be the Democratic convention, where Khizr Khan delivered a riveting speech castigating the arguments that Trump had made. When Trump responded by attacking Khan and his wife, the parents of a slain   soldier, many Americans were dismayed by what they saw. Some Americans who might agree with his attacks on curbing speech in the name of ”political correctness” might not have felt as good after watching and hearing the   clip from ”Entertainment Tonight” in 1992, when Trump can be seen glancing at a group of young girls and saying that he, a    would be dating one of them in about 10 years. His ”I’ll get things done” approach looked less and less like the words of a man who would be efficient and productive and more like someone who employs authoritarian rhetoric. Many opponents had been warning about this, starting in the late summer as Americans witnessed events and heard comments that seemed to make the warnings more real. ’Lock her up’ is what dictators do, When the Republican convention revolved around the chants of ”lock her up,” referring to Clinton, the tenor of the campaign became darker. When Trump quipped at the second debate that if he was president, Clinton would be in jail, many observers shuddered, hearing the kinds of threats that fly in the face of our democratic traditions. ”It’s a chilling thought,” commented Michael Chertoff, who served as secretary of Homeland Security under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ”It smacks of what we read about   dictators in other parts of the world, where, when they win an election, their first move is to imprison opponents.” The entire Trump brand name was built upon him being a winner, not a whiner. The promise was that he claimed he knew what to do. ”Believe me” is a phrase we have consistently heard, and people excused some of his unconventional and   remarks. But he has not been winning. The stories about his checkered business past are now merging with very real evidence of a failing campaign. For core supporters, none of this matters. They love their candidate and will support him until the very end. But there are not enough of them to win the election, and for voters outside of that group, Trump now looks very different    even to some who might have been willing to vote for him. Ruining the brand? It could be that, somehow, Trump miraculously transforms the dynamics of this campaign in the final weeks or that something happens to make Clinton’s campaign implode. The best bet for Trump is that the power of party polarization prevents the bottom from totally falling out as Republican voters are more willing to vote for him over any Democrat. Right now, though, it is not looking good for the GOP    or for its candidate. There are fewer and fewer customers lining up to purchase Trump products. (In fact, New York Magazine reports, Trump’s   hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington is struggling to find customers.) Some even want to return their goods to the store. Politically as well as commercially, the Trump brand is in trouble.', 'Last February, when my    Katrina, was struggling to put together a     family trip for spring break, she turned to a nontraditional travel agent: Leo Kugel of Silver Spring, Md. Leo shelved the original Caribbean plan in favor of New Orleans, selected a hotel that had something for everyone, and found an inexpensive flight. But though at    Leo is at least as tall as your average travel agent, he is actually my    nephew. “We were stalled out, ” Katrina told me. “And he said ‘I’ll take it from here.’ I was a little bit skeptical. ” But aside from a tweak in the flight, everyone  —   Katrina my brother, Jeremy my younger nephew, Grady my mom (a. k. a. Grammy) and my Aunt Nancy  —   agreed to his choices, including a   stay in Le Pavillon. When I heard about this, I may have tilted my head like a dog when it hears a weird noise. When did kids suddenly acquire travel planning skills? I’m pretty sure the first time I picked a hotel was when I met up with my girlfriend in England at age 23. Actually, she probably picked it. But times have changed. “The general concept of your children influencing your vacation,” said Karen Cicero, travel editor at Parents magazine, “whether helping pick the destination or planning part of the trip, is a trend. ” I’m skeptical when people use the   but she pointed to a 2015 survey of 540 parents by YouGov for HomeAway, the vacation rental site, showing that millennial parents are more likely to let their children ages 6 to 18 pick a destination themselves, than children of older parents. It makes sense. Trip planning, these days, takes place mostly online, and children know a thing or two about the internet. Considering that Leo shops for sneakers and jackets online, looking for deals to convince his parents, the jump to hotels doesn’t seem drastic. Ms. Cicero said that social media also played a role. “My daughter is 13, and if you scroll through her Instagram feed, you’ll see pics of her friends’ vacations  —   it gets kids excited and gives them ideas. If you think back to even 10 years ago, school ended and you didn’t find out where your friends had gone until you went back. ” Involving children has benefits beyond   experience. “What this highlights is the importance of getting ” said Rainer Jenss, the president and founder of the Family Travel Association. “A lot of parents don’t consider getting their kids involved in the planning process, dictate it to them and sometimes make assumptions about what would make the kids happy. ” That can lead to   choices like Disney World or   cruises. But “if kids are involved in the decision,” he said, “they have ownership. ” I reached Leo on his cellphone as his parents drove him and Grady to a Massachusetts summer camp. “Everyone wanted to go to the Dominican Republic,” he said, “but it’s pretty expensive, so I tried to find a place that was warm and not too expensive. ” That ended up being New Orleans. He checked a weather app to make sure it wouldn’t be too cold. The hotel was trickier. He knew his parents wanted to be “close to the center but not so close that it would be so loud I couldn’t sleep,” Leo said. He had a priority as well: a pool. A web search led to Groupon. com, where he spotted a photo of Le Pavillon’s rooftop pool. He went to lepavillon. com, and noted that the hotel was “a short stroll to the French Quarter. ” And he didn’t forget the older generation. “It had kind of a French name so it sounded like Grammy might like it. ” Curious if he was on target, I emailed my father, Peter Kugel, who confirmed that his wife might be swayed by a French moniker. He signed the email “Pierre,” and cc’ed her. Some experts caution that while involving children in planning is good, there are no precise guidelines. Parents should set limits appropriate to their own children. (Allow me to interpret: Not every    is as awesome as my nephew.) “Younger kids and some teens don’t necessarily have all the tools to plan a trip in a way that would make everyone happy,” said Mark Bertin, a developmental pediatrician in Pleasantville, N. Y. “But as long as you’re aware of what your child’s really capable of, you could even involve a younger child a little bit. ” Maintaining veto power is a   but so is setting boundaries to avoid having to use it  —   perhaps by preselecting options for children to choose among. “If they make a choice that is not practical, it puts you at loggerheads,” said Dr. Karl Neumann, the pediatrician behind kidstraveldoc. com. But for children who can handle it, open planning encourages them to consider others’ preferences. That was a challenge when Maddie Bates, 15, of Sterling, Va. was put in charge (along with her brother, Tyler, 20) of the yearly family vacation  —   also for a   group of six. Greece was their pick, influenced in part by Maddie’s friends who had visited. In a phone call, Maddie described the different preferences within the group. She is into food, while her brother “likes    kind of stuff. ” Then there’s her dad, who is the reading, relaxing type. Her aunt, Philippa Hughes, is into “arts stuff. ” Maddie’s research method led her away from review sites and toward bloggers who had written narratives on trips to Greece. “It was a lot better than reading reviews on TripAdvisor,” she said, “because you knew what they were doing and how they were feeling when they went to each place. ” She also got tips from friends. To encourage family feedback, the two siblings posted suggested activities on Travefy, which allows collaborative trip planning. But up to a few days before departure, their father and aunt had barely meddled. Not so Maddie’s    Vietnamese grandmother. “I feel she’s kind of scared I’m planning,” said Maddie. “Because she’s been warning me about things she doesn’t like. She’s really just not a fan of walking. ” Being in charge was nice for Maddie, who is low on the hierarchy of her traditional Vietnamese family. “Usually, I don’t plan anything, I just go with the flow,” she said. “It’s nice to be the one planning rather than going on a trip and being like ‘I don’t know what I’m doing.’ ” She sounded more confident in her choices at 15 than Leo did at 12. “There was lots of pressure because if the hotel ended up being junky, it would be my fault,” he said. “But I got a sense of pride that I found the stuff. ” And as it turns out, everyone was happy. Not so on the trek to camp. The family was to spend the night together before the children were dropped off. I asked Leo if he helped plan that trip. “I wish I did,” he replied. “We’re staying at the Super 8. ”', 'Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, told reporters Monday that he could not yet accept an invitation from his American counterpart Donald Trump to the White House because he is unsure of whether he has the time to make it. [While he did not reject the invitation, either, he said he was “tied up” and could not “make any definite promise. ”  “I’m supposed to go to Russia, I’m also supposed to go to Israel,” Duterte noted. If Duterte accepts the invitation, it is unclear whether the State Department would grant him a visa to enter the United States. He has joked in the past that he refuses to even try to enter the country because “I will just be insulted there” and “they won’t give me a visa. ” In October, he claimed to have once attempted to enter the United States when he was in college and was denied a visa, threatening to impose visa restrictions on U. S. citizens in revenge. Duterte is facing a case before the International Criminal Court for allegedly using “death squads” to curb   violence as mayor of his native Davao City, a position he held for 22 years before assuming the presidency. He has claimed to have personally participated in these death squads, wandering the city at night and shooting people dead. President Trump invited Duterte to the White House during a telephone conversation this weekend, a move that baffled observers who have noted Duterte’s consistent   rhetoric since taking office in June 2016, as well as his record of supporting extrajudicial killings vigilante justice against drug criminals. The two world leaders reportedly engaged in a “very friendly conversation” in which Trump offered to host Duterte in the White House. “President Trump also invited President Duterte to the White House to discuss the importance of the United   alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction,” the White House said in a statement. The statement added that the two “discussed the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world. ” While not endorsing Duterte’s war on drugs, the statement did not condemn Duterte’s efforts to rid the country of a methamphetamine (“shabu”) epidemic and the thousands of deaths occurring since he took office. Speaking to reporters Monday, Duterte echoed the warmth of the White House statement, adding that he had also mentioned growing tensions with North Korea. “Our greatest chance there of getting some dialogue with America and North Korea would be through the intercession of China,” he said. Duterte’s civil exchanges with Trump stand in stark contrast to his relationship with the Obama administration. Duterte repeatedly referred to President Barack Obama as a “son of a whore,” told him to “go to hell,” and vowed to sever ties between the United States and the Philippines. “I’ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to (President Vladimir) Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world  —   China, Philippines and Russia. It’s the only way,” he said in October. On Monday, Duterte denied that those comments were a “distancing. ” “It was not a distancing but it was rather a rift between me maybe and the State Department and Mr. Obama, who spoke openly against me,” he claimed. “Things have changed, the new leadership wants to make friends. Well, things have changed, because the new leadership, he (Trump) wants to make friends and he says that we are friends. So, why do you have to pick a fight?” he added. Duterte has presented a favorable disposition towards President Trump since the latter assumed office. In March, Duterte said in public remarks that he was “okay with President Trump and I can assure him also of our friendship and cooperation. ” “But for the previous president, I was an evil man,” he added at the time. “That crazy man was planning to jail me. This other one [Trump] he said, ‘you’re right. ’” In the same remarks, he condemned the European Union for issuing a statement demanding Duterte cease to endorse police brutality against drug suspects, asking of the EU, “why do you have to fuck with us?”   media outlets and   commentators have condemned the White House invitation extended to Duterte. President Obama met with his Filipino counterpart in September at a regional summit despite claiming to have refused to do so, shaking his hand after Duterte had publicly referred to him as a “son of a whore. ” “It was not a long interaction,” Obama claimed. An anonymous official in the Trump White House similarly rejected the idea that meeting the head of state in person was an endorsement. “It’s not a ‘thank you,’ it’s a meeting,” the official told Reuters.', ' (CNN) What started with photographs of a peaceful protest ended with photographs following multiple deaths. Five police officers in downtown Dallas were killed Thursday night during a demonstration held in the wake of the fatal police shootings of two   men    Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. The sniper attack, which came near the end of the demonstration, also left seven officers and two civilians wounded. Smiley Pool, a photographer with The Dallas Morning News, says what came near the beginning of the demonstration was a scene much different. ”One of the very first photographs I was making was of a little girl spinning and twirling and smiling and laughing in a fountain in the park where the rally was,” he said, referring to photo No. 3 in the gallery above. ”There she was, a few feet from this Black Lives Matter rally that was about to start, and she’s just a little girl enjoying a summer day like every other little girl should be doing on a summer day.” Little did Pool, or the little girl, know that the beautiful summertime day, with the Texas heat and a strong breeze, would turn into a night of bloodshed, gunfire and death. Pool describes the night in phases: the rally, the march, the shootings, the search, and, finally, the waiting. The mood at the start, he says, was positive and laid back, with people of all kinds coming together in an upbeat manner as police lined the peripheries. As the speakers started around 7 p. m. and the crowd grew, Pool pulled out his laptop to file some photos. ”I’m kneeling in the middle of the park with my laptop out, sending some early pictures. More to the mood, there are protesters taking pictures of me kneeling there doing my work. And they’re laughing. One guy took his cell phone out and took my picture and was like, ’Hey, I gotcha!’ and I’m like, ’Hey, at least I look like I’m working. Let my boss see that.’ It was friendly.” The march began and although the police presence was considerable    about 100 officers were there    Pool says they, like the demonstrators, were positive. ”They were friendly, professional, they did a masterful job of controlling the traffic flow for the whole march,” he said about the officers at the scene. ”It was obvious that the objective of the police presence during the march was to keep people safe, and really safe from colliding with cars and traffic.” At one point, Pool says, he even heard a police officer tell a protester, who was doing a mock arrest in the middle of the street, to be safe when near the traffic, that it’s dangerous out there. And during the march, one of Pool’s high school friends mentioned to him that this was one of the bigger turnouts she had seen and, as the march continued, Pool says he and a colleague decided to run quickly up a parking garage so they could get an overhead shot of what turned out to be a crowd of about 800 people. That was around 8:40 p. m. At about 8:45 p. m. Pool needed to file more photos so he could meet his newspaper’s print deadline. He left the parking garage and made his way back to his car, where his laptop was. ”I came down the elevator, caught like the last end of the march, so it was a few stragglers,” he said. ”I made a picture from behind of one lone protester kind of on an almost empty street. She was one of the last ones as the police presence was moving their way up from the back.” Just moments later, around 8:55 p. m. everything changed. ”At 8:47, I’m shooting the last stragglers from ground level moving down the street, mostly with the police coming back,” he said. ”At 8:55, I’m making photographs of police on the ground with their guns drawn because the shots had been fired.” Immediately, Pool threw his laptop on the floor of his car, grabbed his cameras, opened the door to get out, got one step out of the car, ”and then just heard: ’POP, POP, POP, POP, POP, POP, POP, POP, POP, POP!’ ” ”I grabbed my cameras and hit the deck,” Pool said. ”Everyone is either running or on the ground. . .. One officer yells over to me to stay low, because the shooter is high, which is the first time I’m aware that perhaps the shooter is in the parking garage    possibly the same parking garage I had just come down from.” He adds that where he was, the police were ”very focused, very on their game.” The image showing a line of officers against the wall with their guns drawn    No. 6    was made while Pool looked down the street as he was squeezed between some cars and behind a police officer for cover. And in photo No. 7, Pool says police officers moved to the location of two civilians. ”A police officer comes up, gun drawn, looking up to the parking garage, to provide cover, while the other two officers evacuate those two guys who were pinned down between cars right near the shooting,” he said. ”Even when the attack is going on, the officers are still protecting the public that was out there. First, it was protecting them from cars, now, they’re protecting them from bullets.” Pool notes there were about 20 to 30   shots, and then nothing, and emphasizes that he had no way of knowing who was doing the shooting, nor did he see everything that was happening. He was about a block and half away from where the shootings took place, and it was about a   span of time that he was able to make photographs as the events unfolded. ”People have asked me, ’What did you see?’ ” he said. ”I saw that little window into what happened. I’m sure it looked different from down the street or around the corner. It’s just one of those: You see what you see from where you are.” Police then worked to move everyone, including Pool, out of the area of the shooting and into safety. That’s when the period of searching and waiting began. ”At this point, you can’t see or hear anything that’s going on,” Pool said. ”There’s not a tension, it’s more of a nervousness. . .. And interestingly enough, I made some new friends among some of the protesters who were in the same boat. A delightful young woman came up and asked me if she could plug into my laptop to try to get a charge on her phone with the USB cable so that she could call her parents, so I was like, ’Yeah sure, I don’t have a lot of juice, but juice up so you can call your folks, I’m sure they would love to hear from you.’ ” He adds that strangers even showed up, offering people water. ”It was almost a full circle of a simple moment of a child playing in a fountain, to this horrible   moment for hundreds and hundreds of people, that took the lives of a bunch of law enforcement officers who had spent the entire evening keeping that crowd of people safe,” Pool said. ”And it circles back to moments of kindness between people stuck out in the street, waiting to get back to their homes or waiting to get back to their cars. The arch of the night was really striking to me.” After the night’s events, Pool says he received a text message from a dear friend of his: ”Was your instinct to take cover greater than your instinct to make a picture?” it read. ”I can’t answer that question,” Pool told me. ”Right now it feels  . On the one hand, I’m like, this is real. It sounds like the bullets are whizzing over you but, who knows, they might not have been. I can’t see where the shooters are. All I’m hearing is pops, and I’m hearing whizzing sounds over our heads. Now, that could be echoes from downtown buildings, or it could be I was in the line of fire    I don’t know. I’ve never been in these situations, I don’t know. I just know, it just got real. And on the other hand, I’m like, I’ve gotta get this picture in focus.” He adds that he never quite felt his life was in danger, but he did feel he was in a ”very vulnerable position.” Earlier in the week, Pool photographed the Fourth of July fireworks festival and some Olympic fencers. His    work is far from what he experienced Thursday night. ”A lot of people have an image of photojournalists that is all death and destruction,” he said. ”I take pictures of ball games. . .. I could have just as easily been assigned to cover the Rangers baseball game (Thursday) night. But here you are in this moment that sort of encapsulates a lot of the fear and anxiety of what, not just our country, our entire civilization, is grappling with, and here you are in the middle of it.” The    Texas native says that while this is a completely heartbreaking incident, he ”absolutely” could imagine something like this would happen in his home state. ”I realize that the universal bad that is among us is not confined to a particular geography or a particular community or a particular people,” he said. ”There are dangers everywhere. Is it profoundly sad to happen in your own community? Absolutely. But nobody’s immune. That’s the one thing I think we all can recognize. No community is immune to any kind of tragedy.” This tragedy, however, was particularly difficult for him. He’s covered natural disasters before, such as Hurricane Katrina, and says it’s easy to understand and accept that mother nature is simply more powerful than all of us. ”It’s more difficult to wrap your brain around dangerous actors who are among you, who apparently think nothing about doing tremendous harm to people going about their everyday lives,” he said. ”That part is saddening and it’s troubling. That’s one of the multitude of things that people will be struggling with.” Ultimately, he describes the entire 12 hours as ”surreal,” and says this experience has served as a reminder of what is truly important in life. ”Cherish the things that are dearest,” Pool said. ”I think I will focus on that for a moment.”', 'Since the election, “Never Trump” means never getting a job in   Donald Trump’s administration, and that’s a bad thing, according to a new Washington Post article. [The article channels the   laments of establishment Republicans who signed the two main “Never Trump” letters during the GOP primaries.  Before he won, the conversation was, ‘We really would love for you to change your mind and join us,’\\u2009” Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser under President George W. Bush, said of informal talks with Trump aides. Feaver, who signed both letters, added that, “Since he won .\\u2009.\\u2009. the conversation is, ‘There likely will be a blacklist of people who signed the letters who won’t themselves be eligible for a post. ’” The “Never Trump” Republicans signed public letters saying Trump “would be the most reckless president in American history. ” Now that Trump is about to take office, they’re prepared to nobly serve their country, but only if Trump will come to his senses and hire them. The Washington Post portrays the routine job consideration of applicant’s loyalty as something sinister and frightening as it presents responses from Republicans surprised they are now unwelcome. According to the Post: “It’s hostile,” said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of further retribution. “It’s not just that we’re frozen out  …     I was told they said there was an enemies list. ” Still, the Post’s editors are standing up for the Republicans they like. “The   has virtually no experience in national security and foreign policy, and his transition team could presumably benefit from the broadest pool of applicants for the influential appointive positions in the State Department, Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security,” the Post snipes. “[T]he purportedly blacklisted figures report to their jobs at Washington law firms and think tanks in a state of indefinite limbo as their colleagues, some working in the same offices, are flirting with potential administration jobs. ” Unhappily for those in the D. C. holding pens, the Trump administration has rejected much of Washington’s   culture and is staffing key posts with military and business leaders. “The   favors people who have been successful in the private sector and amassed personal wealth over those who have achieved prominence in academic or policy fields,” the Post writes in another article. “Those close to him  …     see think tanks as part of a Washington culture that has failed to implement good governance, while becoming beholden to donors. ” The same elite that attended the same schools, lives ensconced in the same wealthy zip codes, holds the same narrow views on trade, immigration, and war, are now competing with an alternative elite brought in by Trump. Given their vitriol during the campaign, and the weeping and gnashing of teeth after Trump’s election night win, getting passed over for an administration job should not be a surprise. But the political class thinks it’s indispensable, and there would be no consequences for them. They believed the 2016 election would be a polite argument between the Clinton and Bush dynasties —  and Trump would never win.

Those arrested include foreign nationals convicted of armed robbery, sex crimes, child abuse, assault, domestic violence, drug offenses, and previously deported aliens. [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) officers carried out a   operation in Nevada. The goal of the targeted operation is to round up aliens with criminal records, prior deportation orders, illegal   and immigration fugitives, ICE officials said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.  “ERO officers here in Nevada and around the country are focused first and foremost on using this agency’s unique tools and authorities to help keep our communities safe,” Nevada ERO Assistant Field Office Director Nikita Curry said in the statement. “Our enforcement efforts last week are representative of the work we’ve been doing and will continue to do. ” Ninety percent of the arrested aliens had records of criminal convictions, officials stated. These records include convictions for various sex crimes, drug offenses, domestic violence, armed robbery, drunk driving, and identity theft. One of those arrested, an Iranian national living in Carson City, Nevada, has a record for illegal drug trafficking. A Salvadoran man living in Reno’s record includes assault, battery, drug possession, and spousal battery, officials stated. Following is the list of crimes committed by 55 of the 61 aliens: *ICE Note: criminal aliens with multiple prior convictions are categorized based on their most serious conviction. The arrestees from last week’s operation include aliens from six different countries. Those include: Mexico (45) Guatemala (6) El Salvador (3) Samoa (2) Armenia (1) Cuba (1) Honduras (1) Iran (1) and Italy (1). ERO officers arrested these criminal aliens in Reno (25) Las Vegas (14) Sparks (5) Stead (4) Elko (3) Winnemucca (3) Lovelock (2) Truckee (2) Battle Mountain (1) Portola (1) and Sun Valley (1). Officials emphasized the operation targeted criminal aliens deemed to be a threat to public safety. The operation also targeted those who   the country illegally after being deported and immigration fugitives who previously received orders of removal from an immigration judge but failed to leave the country. ERO officers may immediately remove those individuals who illegally   the country after removal or who previously received orders of removal from an immigration judge, officials stated. Some of those may face prosecution for illegal   after removal  —   a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Officials will process the remaining criminal aliens for deportation. Officials noted that during these targeted operations some individuals who only violated immigration laws might be picked up. Those cases are evaluated on a    basis to determine if the person is subject to removal. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

There’ll be 10 more of those tonight. ”’ ’As the planned start time for the event drew near, a pair of men with Trump pins on the lapels of their suits sealed the media pen’s exit. “They’re not allowed to leave anymore,” I overheard one suit instruct the other. “Not until he” —  the “he” being Trump —  “has left the building. ”’ ’The   continued and intensified.

Realizing this was folly, they soon mounted a jailbreak.

The cameras raced from one brawl to the next.’ ’When the bedlam flowed outside, I went to a spot where protesters were screaming at people trying to exit the parking garage in their cars. Trump supporters on the garage’s upper levels were jeering at the protesters below, throwing popcorn. “Oh, you’re gonna spit on us now?” said an angry protester, looking up into what did appear to be a hail of expectoration.

To have enlisted for the noble civic duty of election reportage, only to find yourself smack at the center of tinderbox crowds and   atmospherics? Is it tough to endure the troubling,   behavior of the Trump campaign itself?’ ’I followed the circus from Chicago to Cleveland and then down to Florida for a series of rallies, hanging out with Trump’s press pack along the way to find out. When they weren’t busy darting from one skirmish to the next, several Trump reporters (who spoke anonymously because they were not willing or permitted by their news organizations to go on the record) described their experiences out on the trail.’ ’The first thing they all said about Trump’s press operation was that “there is no Trump press operation. ” There’s just Hope Hicks, a twentysomething former Ralph Lauren model who’s never previously worked in politics. She functions more like a celebrity PR shop than a political communications team. And she remains a remote figure. On other campaigns, the press operatives develop chummy relationships with the press corps. “There’s no collegiality,” said one reporter. “No one’s getting dinner with Hope. ”’ ’’ ’While Hicks writes up the emails and press releases, Trump is his own media strategist. And in some ways he’s the most accessible candidate of all —  as long as you’re a TV host like CNN’s Don Lemon or MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. But there’s no    information coming from his campaign, no one else but Trump (and occasionally his campaign manager) to talk to. Where other candidates might have a dozen aides a journalist can develop as sources, along with donors and pollsters and   who’ll leak inside scoop, with Trump there’s none of that. Maybe you get some   operatives on the phone, but it doesn’t matter because they never know anything. “You don’t get sourced up like you normally would,” one reporter told me. “It all happens on the surface. You just try to interpret it. ”’ ’Asking policy questions is like throwing a rock down a bottomless well. “If I have a question about women’s issues, or Hispanic issues,” said one reporter, “it’s not like they point me to specific press liaisons who handle those. There aren’t any such people. ” Most policy queries simply go unanswered. When a response does come back, it’s rarely sufficient. “There’s no point anyway,” said another reporter. “You might get a response to a question about immigration policy, but the next day on TV, Trump will contradict it. ”’ ’And of course there are the lies. Politico Magazine  more than 60 in a week of Trump appearances. At a rally in Boca Raton, Florida, on March 13, I heard him utter at least two bald untruths in the first two minutes of his speech (he said there were 25, 000 people at his Chicago rally when the arena holds fewer than 10, 000, and then he repeated the falsehood that no one had been injured at the event). But journalists I talked to who continue to report the lies as such don’t feel their efforts have much effect. “How many times can you write that the same statement is untrue?” mused one reporter. “At some point, the lie stops being news. ” And debunking a claim doesn’t stop Trump from making it again.’ ’The hokum washes over you after a while. A reporter sitting next to me at the Saturday rally in Cleveland chuckled when Trump bragged there were 29, 000 people in the room. “That can’t be remotely possible,” she said, lifting her head for a moment to assess the crowd, then giving up and returning her gaze to her laptop. A fire marshal later announced the attendance had been about 7, 000. The lie, though, never made it into her piece. Why bother to spend the time and column space to correct a silly exaggeration, when this same man has said he might want to summarily execute enemy combatants and defile their bodies? You need to pick your battles.’ ’’ ’“We used to   everything, every day,” another reporter told me, “but it gets hard to keep up. ” For a writer filing on deadline an hour after a rally ends, there’s not enough time to thoroughly   the dozens of fabrications that spilled from the stage. It’s also hard to know who the   is for. At this point, anyone who hates Trump has ample evidence he’s a liar. And anyone who loves Trump doesn’t care.’ ’The more time I spent with the Trump press pack, the more sympathy I had for them. They display equanimity in the face of outrageous behavior. They display physical courage in the face of near rumbles. Perhaps I’m a fragile soul —  Trump would no doubt come up with a snappy epithet to encapsulate my   —  but I’m not sure that I could handle the emotional rigors of their workplace.’ ’The Thunderdome vibe at Trump events set my teeth on edge. Each time the mood tautened, I’d wonder: Is this the day a truly tragic thing happens? I found it unsettling that the loudest cheers at these rallies —  the moments when the crowd would unleash pure glee and actual fist pumps —  came when Trump would direct his security team to eject a protester by shouting, “OK, get him out!” The press isn’t allowed to exit or enter the designated pen while the rallies are happening, which means you can either stay inside to get separation from the crowds (and a usable workspace) or stay outside to get   footage of altercations happening amid the throngs (unless,  you’re threatened with arrest for doing so).’ ’I also could not abide large, repeated doses of   Trump. It infuriated me when he’d pause between telling blatant whoppers to point at the media pen and say, “Those are very dishonest people, I have to tell you. ” On cue, his minions would spin around and boo us.’ ’Sometimes, he gets personal with the press. At one rally, Trump referred to NBC News reporter Katy Tur as “little Katy,   journalist” while she was in the pen, surrounded by his   groupies. In February, Tur tweeted about another special moment on the trail:’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’tTrump trashes press. Crowd jeers. Guy by press ’’pen’’ looks at us & screams ”you’’re a bitch!” Other gentleman gives cameras the double bird. ’t’t’ ’The longtime Trump embeds are a   group. They gossip and commiserate. After Deb’s arrest, there was a flurry of texts coordinating ways to help, checking on the latest updates. They have to remind themselves not to get inured to their surroundings. Things that a year ago might have seemed monumentally loony, or    unacceptable, now barely raise an eyebrow. “I think we need troop rotations for the embedded reporters,” suggested one writer. “You need a fresh set of eyes to say, ‘I can’t believe what I just saw.’ ”’ ’Despite the heavy adjectives getting thrown around —  fascist, demagogue, authoritarian —  the beat reporters I spoke to mostly felt they couldn’t use that kind of language. Opinion writers, sure. But straight news journalists felt the best they could do was catalog the madness and let the American citizenry decide. Some writers objected to the idea that they were giving Trump too much coverage —  after all, he’s the GOP   and this campaign is something we’ve never seen before. At least one writer did, however, feel the situation was different when it comes to cable news, where Trump’s thirst for airtime and the networks’ thirst for ratings can profoundly skew the calculus.’ ’’ ’As the Trump campaign has accrued power, its treatment of the media has grown ever more worrisome. Reporters told me that Trump is incredibly attuned to his coverage in a way that other presidential candidates aren’t. The campaign will sometimes single out specific outlets for vindictive treatment. The Des Moines Register, the New York Times, BuzzFeed, and Univision were all denied access to Trump events in the wake of running negative coverage. Both the  and the  have already felt compelled to fire their first meek shots over Trump’s bow.’ ’Trump’s campaign manager, former New Hampshire state police officer Corey Lewandowski, was recently accused of. Whatever the severity of the manhandling, the campaign’s response in the aftermath has been, to use a favorite Trump word, “disgusting. ” Despite photographic evidence and an immediate eyewitness report  the campaign continues to deny that the incident ever happened. Hicks attacked the Breitbart reporter’s integrity, releasing a statement including this line: “We leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents, but on multiple occasions she has become part of the news story as opposed to reporting it. ” that the Breitbart reporter was “delusional. ” There’s no shame, no accountability, no decency. “Trump surrounds himself with a bunch of dicks,” shrugged one writer, referring to Lewandowski, and other reporters I spoke to tended to agree. On Saturday, Lewandowski was again  this time with a protester in Arizona, and again  despite visual evidence.’ ’A couple of journalists on the Trump beat were already beginning to express concern about how the media might fare under a Trump presidency, if he should win. The previous two presidents have been imperfect in their treatment of the press —  both Bush and Obama closed ranks and tightened access in ways that previous administrations hadn’t —  but basic norms pertained. Would Trump honor quaint traditions regarding White House press coverage? No one knows. “It’s occurring to me that it’s a really fucking slippery slope,” said one reporter. “I’ve been assuming the White House Correspondents’ Association would negotiate for traditional access and protocols. But I’m applying a rational schema to this. What’s to prevent Donald Trump from just getting rid of the WHCA? Trump doesn’t let the press pack on his plane now, something that other candidates all do. Would President Trump let reporters on Air Force One? ”’ ’Campaigns can provide a window into how an administration will be run. The vast machinery of American governance might in many ways keep an outlandish President Trump in check. But there’s not much to prevent Trump’s White House press shop from resembling his press shop now: capricious, inscrutable, vindictive, insulated. I’m imagining President Trump communicating solely via tweets and   to cable news shows. I’m imagining the New York Times —  a paper that Trump says “allows dishonest reporters to totally fabricate stories” —  getting barred on a whim from the White House briefing room. I’m imagining journalists emailing policy questions to press secretary Hope Hicks and receiving no response. (Hicks did not respond to emailed questions for this story. )’ ’’ ’On Tuesday night, as the primary returns rolled in, reporters flocked to the luxurious confines of    Trump’s personal residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Some of us had dressed more formally than out on the trail, to match the surroundings. The balmy, scented air wafted over us as we strolled across the lawns and proceeded through the Secret Service security check at the door. Once inside, we mingled beneath the gaudy chandeliers of the enormous Donald J. Trump Ballroom, waiting for the man to appear.’ ’As we were enjoying Mr. Trump’s hospitality, another reporter was being turned away at the    gates. Politico writer Ben Schreckinger had been previously approved for credentials, only to . He was told to leave the grounds. Later that evening, Trump  “a dishonest,   reporter with a failing outlet that will soon be out of business, hopefully. ”’ ’Sopan Deb had made it past the door. He was sporting a new abrasion beneath his chin, where he’d made contact with Chicago pavement four days before. The police would later drop the charges against him, and he seemed to be taking the whole thing in stride. But getting arrested wasn’t even the first unfortunate personal incident Deb had endured while on the Trump trail. At a January rally in Reno, Nevada, a Trump supporter  (adding, “Yeah, I’m talking to you” when Deb looked at him in shock). I asked him if, given the unique nature of this campaign and his experiences covering it, he feels any special responsibility to raise alarms in his work. “All I can do is my job,” he said. “Whether my reporting makes any difference is out of my control. ”   ’ ’Trump had taken questions from the press during his previous election night celebrations at   . The first time, a reporter told me, he’d seated his rich friends and    Club members in the front two rows and put the press behind them. The next time, Trump’s friends had been given the front seven rows, pushing the press farther back. But Tuesday night, as Trump basked in victory, there were a full 16 rows of rich pals —  500 or so elegantly dressed Palm Beach dandies —  banishing reporters to the rear of the ballroom, about 40 yards away from Trump’s podium.’ ’I asked my press pack friends how they were going to ask him questions from this distance. They weren’t sure. They guessed they might be given microphones. One print reporter assured me she had a really big voice.’ ’It turned out not to matter. Though the event had been labeled a “press conference,” and we’d all obtained credentials on that basis, Trump gave a short speech —   —  called reporters “disgusting,” and then exited the room without fielding a single question. My friend with the big voice shouted, “This is supposed to be a press conference! Aren’t you going to talk to us? !”’ ’We could hear her loud and clear. But Trump strolled past without acknowledging her. If you want a picture of a future Trump presidency, imagine a reporter shouting questions into an empty void.’ ’*Correction, March 21, 2016: This piece originally misstated that reporter Sopan Deb had been detained in jail overnight. He was detained for several hours, but not overnight.’ ’On March 11, an hour before the scheduled. ..’', 'Michelle Obama joined Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s The Tonight Show for one final evening of games and jokes before her husband, President Obama, leaves office this month  —   and the departing First Lady also got a private concert from Stevie Wonder.

Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum', 'Former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw agrees with Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, who asserts that the sentiment behind the   revolt that has catapulted Donald Trump to the Republican presidential nomination has its origins in the “can do”   and independence captured in the former anchor’s book, The Greatest Generation. [During a live   interview at Sirius XM’s broadcasting headquarters in New York City  that began with the story of his medical journey with multiple myeloma, Brokaw went on to share with Breitbart News Daily host Bannon his views on the Greatest Generation and the 2016 presidential election.  Bannon noted that, in his view, the current   vote powering the campaigns of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders is “like, really the Greatest Generation book, because you wrote about the Greatest Generation, and who fought the war, not from the general’s level, but from the little guy, the guy in the trenches, the guy that had to climb the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc, the guys that had to storm the beaches, the guys in the Pacific that took Peleliu and Tarawa, it was their voices. ” “Isn’t that national pride, this nationalism, this populism, isn’t it predicated on that Greatest Generation determination, that grit?” Bannon asked. “There’s no question about that,” Brokaw answered. “I still see myself as the correspondent from Main Street. I get it,” the veteran broadcaster added. “It’s my fiftieth year at NBC and we’re doing a whole series. Ten, twelve years ago, I was out in the middle of Ohio talking about the lost American dream, about manufacturing disappearing from places like Toledo, Ohio, which was the home of Libbey Glass at that time. About how the working class had changed in Detroit. Now everybody was on the run. They would get an assignment in the morning and they would have to go to Cincinnati, or they would have to go to different places,” Brokaw said. “On the other hand, you do see those towns where they said, OK, we’ve got to reinvent ourselves. That era is gone, we’ve got to find a new way of doing things, and they’ve been enterprising at doing it. ” The Greatest Generation, first published in 1998, chronicles how the little guys in America —  the grunt fighting on the front lines of combat, his wife or girlfriend working in the plane factory at home —  won World War II. “Do you see this   vote, whether it’s Bernie Sanders on the left, or Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Tea Party groups on the right, do you think the establishment of both parties, and the intellectual and cultural elite of the country have let the country down? That we’re kind of in this  …    almost leaderless?” Bannon asked. “I think what they’ve done is separate themselves from the country,” Brokaw jumped in. “I think  …    they didn’t listen to the country before this cycle. It’s become a kind of   process in Washington. Everybody, because of gerrymandering, Democrats and Republicans, are generally in good shape about getting back,” Brokaw said. “They live good lives. They spend a lot of their time just raising money. When I was growing up, the congressman would come back and walk Main Street. Now they go to a country club and raise dough,” he explained. “So I think there is a real profound separation,” the South Dakotan added. “On the other hand, I think that there are so many more strengths in this country than people are now willing to acknowledge. We’re in better shape than most people think we are in terms of prosperity and where we’re making gains in medical care and other areas,” he noted. As for presidential politics, Brokaw had plenty to say. “I’ve been covering presidential politics for NBC News for fifty years, so I have kind of a memory,” Brokaw told Bannon. “You said 1968 is the year it all jammed together,” Bannon said. “There’s never been a year for news [like that] like maybe 1989 [when the Berlin Wall fell] do you think, particularly with California coming up next week that we could have a come from behind victory by Bernie Sanders [in the Democratic primary]?  …     Do you think he can pull an upset there?” Bannon asked. “Yes, I do,” Brokaw answered. “My colleagues are tired of hearing me say this, but it’s held up over the years. My favorite theory of politics, every cycle, is what I call the UFO theory, the unforeseen will occur,” he explained. “I never get involved with who’s going to win, who’s going to lose at the beginning or even midway through. What I try to do is describe the consequences of what may happen, and what the possibilities are here,” he continued. “Bernie Sanders is on a roll, he’s ramping up at this point. She’s [Hillary Clinton] got difficulties, and the country is   in the ticked off position. They’re willing to pull the pin on the grenade and roll it in to the process, and kind of frag the process if you will. That means that the younger voters in California who have no attachment to Hillary, you know, she’s been around for a long time,” Brokaw observed. “This guy comes around and says a lot of unrealistic things about free health care, free college, that kind of thing. But he’s obviously touching a big political nerve,” the veteran NBC journalist added. Bannon closed out the interview by asking Brokaw about President Obama’s recent trip to Hiroshima, Japan. “I have no problem with what Harry Truman did. None whatsoever,” Brokaw said of Truman’s decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagaski to end World War II in 1945. “They didn’t get it. I thought maybe he could have delayed Nagasaki a day or two later, because it was pretty quick right after Hiroshima that he pulled the trigger on the second bomb  …    I think he could have given a little more time for unconditional surrender, and made it clear, if you think that was bad, watch what’s coming next. Unconditional surrender, right now. But, on both bombs, I have no problem with it. That was going to end the war,” he noted. “Japanese prisoner of war camps were really brutal, by the way,” Brokaw added.

[Domestic employers added a   235, 000 new jobs last month, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4. 7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.  Both construction and manufacturing saw strong jobs gains. Economists expected nonfarm payrolls to grow by 190, 000, compared with 227, 000 in January. Unofficially, however, expectations have been rising this week following a blowout jobs figure from ADP on Wednesday. Wage pressure remains muted. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents and 2. 8 percent on an annualized basis. The average work week in the private sector was unchanged at 34. 4 hours. January’s employment was revised upward to 238, 000 from the earlier read of 227, 000. The employment gains were broad based, occurring in construction, private sector educational services, manufacturing, health care and mining. The jobless rate for adult men and women was 4. 3 percent. The labor force participation rate, at 63. 0 percent was close to unchanged. Construction employment increased by 58, 000 jobs. Manufacturing added 28, 000 jobs. Over the past 3 months, manufacturing has added 57, 000 jobs. Health care employment rose by 27, 000 jobs. Mining employment increased by 8, 000 jobs.  Employment in business and professional services rose by 37, 000 jobs. The report covered the first full month of President Donald Trump’s administration. During the 2016 race, Trump was critical of the unemployment rate, arguing that it understated the level of joblessness in the United States.    ', ' (The Hollywood Reporter) Sam Simon, the   Emmy   comedy writer and producer who helped develop ”The Simpsons,” made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity, has died, his foundation announced on Facebook. He was 59. Simon was diagnosed in February 2013 with terminal colon cancer. Yet through it all, he tried to remain upbeat and keep his sense of humor. ”The Museum of Broadcasting called and said, ’We were thinking about doing an archive interview with you. Do you mind if we did it now?’ ” Simon said with a laugh on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast that first ran in May 2013. During his brief career, the influential Simon also served as the showrunner on the sitcom ”Taxi” at the age of 23 wrote for and produced the comedies ”Cheers” and ”The Drew Carey Show” and created a Fox series for the legendary   comic George Carlin in the  . Simon also wrote the 1991 film ”The Super,” a 20th Century Fox comedy starring Joe Pesci as a New York slumlord. Most recently, Simon was a consultant on the Charlie Sheen series ”Anger Management” and hosted a show on Radioio. com. He showed up frequently on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show and in March 2013 thanked the acerbic host for being ”the perfect friend.” Story: Terminally Ill ’Simpsons’   Vows to Give Away Fortune, ’His comedy is all about character’ A cartoonist and Stanford graduate, Simon developed ”The Simpsons” with Matt Groening (who came up with the characters based on his family) and producer James L. Brooks. All three had worked on ”The Tracey Ullman Show,” where Bart Simpson and his family got their start as animated sketches shown before and after commercials. ”The Simpsons,” centering on TV’s ”first fully   dysfunctional family,” as Simon put it, debuted on Fox on December 17, 1989, and is now the   primetime series in American history. Ken Levine, an Emmy winner who has written for ”The Simpsons” and other sitcoms, described Simon’s contribution to the show during a 2009 interview published in Stanford Magazine. ”Sam brought a level of honesty to the characters,” Levine said. ”Is it too bizarre to say he made cartoon characters  ? His comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In ’The Simpsons,’ the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. ’What are they thinking?’    that is Sam’s contribution. The stories come from the characters.” Simon also is credited with assembling the show’s elite writing team that included Al Jean, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti and Conan O’Brien. Story: James L. Brooks on ’Simpsons’ journey, ”I remember Sam coming into the room, and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated,” O’Brien told Vanity Fair in 2007. ”He’s hilarious. It was fun to try and make him laugh. I remember that about Sam. If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited.” Tired of the grind, Simon exited the show in 1993 after four seasons but worked out a deal tied to home video sales that he said paid him ”tens of millions” every year. The agreement also guaranteed him executive producer credit long after he departed, and his name appears in the credits of every episode. A couple of years after he left, Simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business. He was in his  . Praise ’like Tom Sawyer’s funeral’ As detailed in The Hollywood Reporter’s 2013 Philantrophy Issue, Simon’s charitable contributions include founding the   Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs. His other pet charities include PETA, which in February thanked him for his support by naming its Norfolk, Virginia, headquarters The Sam Simon Center international nonprofit Save the Children and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a global marine conservation organization. His generosity led the latter in 2012 to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels    used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing    the   Simon. Simon also turned a Malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf. ”The sort of lifetime achievement stuff that I’m getting now is kind of like Tom Sawyer’s funeral because they all know I’m sick,” Simon told THR’s Gary Baum. ”I am getting buildings named after me and awards and stuff. The truth is, I have more money than I’m interested in spending. Everyone in my family is taken care of. And I enjoy this.” In May 2014, it was revealed that Simon spent $60, 000 to rescue an abused thoroughbred. Simon, who won eight of his Emmys for   ”The Simpsons” (many after he left) and one for producing ”The Tracey Ullman Show,” was married to and divorced from actress Jennifer Tilly (1984 to 1991) and Playboy Playmate Jami Ferrell (for mere weeks in 2000). Neither marriage produced any children. Across the street from Groucho, Born June 6, 1955, Simon grew up in Beverly Hills in an era when the neighborhood was ”quaint,” as he put it. Groucho Marx lived across the street, and he recalled walking into his parents’ room as a youngster and finding the legendary comic and his mom sitting on the bed. (He stressed they weren’t about to have sex.) Another time, Elvis Presley returned the dog that Simon had lost. While at Stanford, Simon drew cartoons for the local newspapers in San Francisco and the school paper and landed a job at Filmation Studios doing storyboards for ”The New Adventures of Mickey Mouse” and ”Heckle  Jeckle.” Simon scored his first TV writing gig on the animated ”Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids” in 1979. He mailed in a script to ”Taxi” (  by Brooks) that was accepted, and that led to a staff writing position and then the job as showrunner. Simon also went on to direct episodes of the Carlin show, ”The Drew Carey Show,” ”Friends,” ”Norm” and ”Anger Management.” An avid poker player, Simon   his home game in a penthouse at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for a Playboy TV show in 2009. The show also featured Tilly    a very good player    as well as comedians Dave Attell, Norm Macdonald, Jeffrey Ross and Artie Lange. Another one of Simon’s more eclectic pursuits was working the corner at amateur fights and serving as president of Sweet Science Inc. which managed boxer Lamon Brewster. His fighter stunningly knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to win a share of the heavyweight championship in 2004. During his chat with Maron, Simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to ”list the three things he loves to do. When he can’t do those any longer, it’s time. ”One of my three things is laying in bed and watching TV. So by that criteria, I will never be euthanized.” Later, talking about all the millions he’s given to charity, he added: ”I kinda like it when people talk about me as a special person. But I know I would be a nut if I didn’t have a lot of money.” People we’ve lost in 2015', 'One of the 20 or so courses served to me the first time I ate at the new Aska in Brooklyn was a cluster of nasturtium leaves, next to a bundle of burned herb sprigs and flower stalks, tied up with a string. It looked pretty and pagan at the same time, like a page from a Martha Stewart lifestyle magazine for witches. This plate was more than just photogenic, though. Wrapped inside the scorched bouquet was a langoustine, very gently cooked to a soft pink. It tasted of herbs and ashes. There were blots of chamomile jelly and a   sauce on the plate, too, and when I rubbed a bit of the   lobster around in there, the combination of flower and shellfish flavors was a complete surprise, extraordinary in ways I’d never imagined before. One of the rewards of working as a restaurant critic for a few years is getting to see chefs growing into their ambitions. On my watch, few have done this as dramatically and successfully as Aska’s chef, Fredrik Berselius. Aska, which opened beneath the ribs of the Williamsburg Bridge in July, is his third restaurant. And with each fresh incarnation, his cooking has taken a leap forward. His first, in 2012, was a   operation called Frej, which shared its space in Williamsburg with a ramen outfit and a coffee bar. Its   menu was a great deal at $45, and Mr. Berselius, who was born and raised in Sweden, was already showing a gift for delicately naturalistic compositions in the New Nordic style. But some of the flavors were tentative, like underexposed photographs. Mr. Berselius fleshed out some of those sketches when he turned Frej into a   restaurant, called Aska. The menus were longer and a little more expensive. Some dishes were too subdued and others were just   I may still have a bit of a  ’  cracker stuck between my teeth. The pleasures, however, were numerous and original enough to persuade me that Aska was easily a   restaurant. Less than two years in, though, Mr. Berselius closed Aska, saying that he had outgrown the site. New York’s real estate and construction industries being what they are, it took him more than two years to find and then renovate the new space, a warehouse from the Civil War era about a mile south. He installed a bar and lounge in the basement, a patio in the courtyard and a moody main dining area and open kitchen in the soaring,   room at street level. Mr. Berselius must have used some of that time to bear down in the kitchen, too, because his new tasting menus vault past the ones at the old Aska. They are longer, and much more expensive, at $145 for 10 courses and $215 for 19 courses, service included. But the flavors don’t hide anymore they have an insistent presence, and their dynamics are beautifully modulated from one dish to the next. You will still be eating things you probably didn’t think you wanted to eat. A new pig’s blood creation has replaced the cracker, and this time it leaves a memory I’m happy to be haunted by. The blood lends a mineral tang to an appealingly tender traditional Swedish pancake set under rose petals, cherries and a   rose hip jelly. It looks, and even tastes, a little like a thin chocolate cake. (Blood imitates chocolate again in a little truffle that shows up at the end of the night.) Reindeer lichen, another ingredient that didn’t entirely win me over last time around, is back. I may never learn to love the way a clump of it feels in my mouth  —   like a cross between kataifi pastry and a hairball  —   but I loved the chanterelles and their broth that surrounded the lichen and the swoosh of cream, cooked down to a caramelized sweetness, that was hiding beneath. Mr. Berselius is the rare chef who thinks like an artist and gets away with it. His Nature Boy act took a turn toward the mystical on a recent night as he delivered a dish to the table he recalled seeing a small flock of sheep in the Catskills, amid hills overrun with bedstraw. He said he wanted to bring the two together, which he accomplished by placing lambs’ hearts under burning bedstraw until the hearts collapse into ashes. These ashes are then scattered over sunchoke cream mixed with pickled sunchokes. The pairing of bitter cinders and sweet sunchokes was fascinating, and reminded me of baking chocolate grated over melted white chocolate. But one or two tastes were enough for me incinerated heart may be better expressed as a   or   snack, like the   puff of pommes soufflées, topped with wonderfully smoky flounder roe. Part of the program at Aska asks us to look again at nature, and to try ingredients that aren’t sold in any supermarket. Mr. Berselius does impressive things with more ordinary materials, though, like the slabs of scallop and their   roe with   brown butter spooned over the top, or a simple and remarkably good stick of roasted king crab leg with tiny potatoes, cooked almost al dente. The procession of plants and seafood is usually broken up by some red meat right before dessert. Once, it was   beef bathed in rendered beef fat, tasting the way the air at Peter Luger smells: hypnotic. More recently, there were a few   slices of wild wood pigeon, brought in from Scotland a very fine thing on a chilly, windy fall night. After that came an amazing sorbet of raw milk served with little strawberries preserved during the summer, along with some fermented juice on its way to becoming wine. This was followed by birch ice cream under white slices of raw pine mushrooms and woodruff leaves, an odd, herbaceous and unexpectedly stirring combination. In my tour of duty, I’ve eaten a number of dishes that were supposed to represent a walk in the woods, but none came as close to capturing the forest’s aromas as this one. The service is warm and unpretentious, even down to earth. Guidance through the wine list, which has some fashionably esoteric choices alongside some excellent, familiar ones, isn’t quite as fluid as at the old Aska, but the servers know how to listen and respond. Their tone is especially welcoming in the basement lounge, where you can sprawl on a couch or unwind at a small table over a martini that’s been Nordicized with Icelandic birch liqueur and syrup distilled from prehistoric amber. The à la carte menu downstairs offers a fantastic cured pork shoulder in mushroom vinaigrette, or   lettuce leaves dotted with a mash of smoked hake that tastes like unusually good gefilte fish. These and other dishes may not be the makings of a filling weeknight meal, but they do provide a fine,   introduction to the Aska worldview. Mr. Berselius has a lyrical sensibility, though it seems to have abandoned him when it came time to design the main dining room. The tablecloths and the ceiling are black, which makes most of the room disappear. When I was there, most of the tables were taken by couples seated side by side, facing the open kitchen. It looked as if they were at a cabaret, waiting for the show to start. By the third hour of the night, I was restless and conscious of the passage of time I kept expecting the cooks to do something, maybe sing a little Sondheim. The atmosphere at a lot of   restaurants can feel a little inert. This tends not to matter very much to most customers, few of whom are going to put a $215   menu into their regular rotation. What they want is a delicious, memorable night that takes them to places they haven’t been before. Aska does all of that, and throws in a little blood and poetry.', 'Monday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” the founder and editor at large of The Weekly Standard and “Never Trump” movement figure Bill Kristol said   Donald Trump has “not been thinking as a   for the last two months,” warning Trump’s tweets are “just popping off. ”  Kristol said, “What most startling to me is he’s president elect of the United States, he’s going to be sworn in, in four days. Is it wise? Is it prudent? And I’m not talking even about politics here or a kind of courtesy. He has serious obligations. Should he be denigrating our standing in the world? That’s what he’s doing in this tweet really. NATO, he said NATO is obsolete. He may think that. He said it as a candidate. When you’re president do you want to say the alliance of which you’re an integral part is obsolete? Don’t you say I’m going to working to change NATO, to improve it, meanwhile I’ll be standing by the treaty obligation. He’s so far away from behaving the way a president has, the way other presidents have acted. ” “They’ve inherited policies and inherited personnel and disagreed with,” he continued. “The is always pretty transitions rocky as the power gets handed off from one party to another but they’ve tried to be careful not to damage the country when they’re making their own political points. I think that’s true of President Obama when he was   and President Bush when he was   goes all the way back. And Trump’s just, it’s not even, fine he may make a couple of errors but seems to have no appreciation he should be thinking this way. I guess that’s what I find the most unnerving, he’s not been thinking as a   for the last two months. Hopefully on Friday he starts to think as a president. ” He added, “It’s not very hard, if you put yourself in the mind that I’m no longer speaking my mind wherever I want, I’m no longer rallying my base, I’m no longer shocking people, carefully selected surprises, that’s one thing but just popping off in this way I mean it really does become damaging, somewhat damaging when you’re   very damaging I think when you’re president. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN', 'Istanbul (CNN) With flags across Turkey at   and the nation observing a day of mourning, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proclaimed the terror attack on Istanbul’s airport ”will not divide or split our country.” Erdogan promised the government will ”not let down our people.” He said by killing dozens of civilians, including women and children, the terrorists were not true Muslims.  ”This is not Islamic. Taking one person’s life means going straight to hell,” he said Wednesday from the capital of Ankara, adding, ”No terrorist organization will come between what we are.” Erdogan’s televised comments came a day after he said in a written statement that an attack during the final days of the holy month of Ramadan show the attackers had no regard for faith or values. No terror group has taken responsibility for the attack, in which three men arrived by taxi at the international terminal and launched their horror armed with rifles and suicide bomb vests. Speculation, based on the nature of the attack, has focused on the Islamic State, which has struck in Turkey before but rarely taken credit for those bombings. Interior Minister Efkan Ala said ”all information and evidence” points to ISIS. ”But nothing is for certain.” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said initial findings ”suggest all three attackers first opened fire then detonated themselves.” That method is similar to the mass shooting and suicide bombings at Paris’ Bataclan concert hall last November. ISIS claimed responsibility for that massacre, which left 89 people dead.  ISIS has a history of airport attacks. In March, it claimed responsibility for dual suicide bombings at the main airport in Brussels, Belgium. At least 10 people died in those blasts.  And just like the Brussels attack, the terrorists in Istanbul took a taxi to the airport.  The Istanbul taxi driver was interviewed by police and released, the Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported.  The director of the U. S. Central Intelligence Agency, using another acronym for the Islamic State, said he thinks the terror attack ”certainly bears the hallmarks of ISIL’s depravity.” John Brennan said he wasn’t surprised that ISIS hasn’t said it was responsible. The group rarely takes credit for attacks in Turkey. ”I think what they do is they carry out these attacks to gain the benefits from it in terms of sending a signal to our Turkish partners,” he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, ”(and at) the same time not wanting to potentially maybe alienate some of those individuals inside of Turkey that they may still be trying to gain the support of.” Victims from around the world  The death toll is now 42, according to  Anadolu, which cited hospital sources. The toll rose after a woman died at a hospital in Istanbul. Many of the dead were Turkish, including 10 airport staff members, TAV Airports CEO Sani Sener said.  The attack killed six Saudis and wounded 27 more, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry said.  The other victims included two Iraqis, one Tunisian, one Chinese, one Iranian, one Ukrainian, one Jordanian and one person from Uzbekistan, a Turkish official said. Three of the foreigners had dual Turkish citizenship.  Of the 239 people wounded Tuesday night, 128 remained hospitalized, officials said.  The three terrorists  The assailants have not been identified, but there is a ”strong suggestion that they are foreign,” a senior Turkish government source told CNN.  Experts say Turkey is especially vulnerable due to the variety of terrorists operating there.  ”You cannot protect these airports 100% . .. especially in a place like Turkey, where ISIS has cells everywhere,” said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a former U. S. military attaché in Syria.  ISIS promised an uptick in attacks during the holy month of Ramadan, which is nearing its end.  And the terror group has reason to detest Turkey: The country is helping the U. S.  coalition attack ISIS targets in neighboring Iraq and Syria.  Turkey allows coalition planes to fly raids from its territory.  Adding to the instability: Last year, Turkey resumed hostilities with the PKK, Kurdish militant separatists, after a   cease fire broke down. But over the last few months, ”the Turks have really changed their focus from only the PKK to going after ISIS as well,” Francona said.  Understanding Turkey’s deadly catalog of enemies, Airport reopens quickly, Just five hours after terrorists struck, travelers returned to the site of the carnage    much to the surprise of some critics. ”I find this totally astonishing,” said Professor Larry Kobilinsky of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ”I’ve never seen such a massive crime scene looked at for five hours. It’s just impossible. You’re going to compromise, you’re going to contaminate evidence. . .. They should not have turned this open to the public.”  Passengers walked over shards of glass as workers tried to wash away blood at Ataturk Airport.  But the airport’s operator defended its actions and its security, saying it exceeds international standards.  And unlike many American and European airports, ”We have security checkpoints at the entrance of the terminal building,” Sener said.  Those extra measures didn’t stop the bombers, who started firing   rifles immediately after getting out of a taxi, Sener said.  Despite the horror and carnage, ”Everything’s quite calm right now, which is a little surreal as opposed to the scenes we saw here last night,” witness Laurence Cameron said.  ”I was in the airport this morning looking for my lost luggage,” he said. ”They were sweeping up debris, and someone had hung up a big Turkish flag, pretty much right at the spot where (a) bomb had gone off    sort of an act of defiance, which was quite moving.” Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute, said he believes the attack was designed to hurt Turkey’s tourism industry, which brings in more than $30 billion in revenue per year, according to its government. ”I think this was a deliberate effort on behalf of the Turkish government to give a message outside,” he said of the airport’s reopening. ”Because if ISIS, by carrying out the attack, tried to undermine Turkey’s image as a place that’s safe for business and safe for visitors, by getting the airport up and running and functioning in less than a day after the attack, Turkey’s basically saying, ’Never mind, this was just a lapse, we’re back in business. ’” A few shops inside the airport remained closed Wednesday, but for the most part the terminal where the attack took place was open. The only area that was closed was where one of the bombs went off. It was cordoned off by boards with advertisements on them. There was a memorial in front of one food stand, a black table covered with roses and a photo of two of Tuesday’s victims. Lots of blood, broken glass, The cacophony of gunfire Tuesday night was quickly followed by the deafening blows of three explosions.  Witness Sue Savage said about 30 people were herded into a women’s prayer room until authorities led them out and down an escalator into the main terminal hall. Coverage from CNN Turk, ”There was a lot of blood,” she said. ”There was so much glass on the floor, they were scuffing it aside so we didn’t slip.” Video from inside the terminal shows the bright orange flash of fire from one of the explosions. Victims stagger. Some fall on the slippery,   floor. Another video shows a gunman dropping his weapon when he’s apparently shot by a security officer. The man slumps to the ground, and the officer briefly stands over him before running.  About 10 seconds later, a bomb detonates.  8 attacks so far this year  Turkey has spent much of this year reeling from terror attacks as it weathers bombing campaigns by both ISIS and Kurdish militants. The attack marked the eighth suicide bombing event in Turkey this year. At least 140 people have been killed.  The violence has also rattled Turkey’s tourism industry, a key sector of the national economy. About 39. 4 million people visit each year.', 'Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday in an interview on New York AM 970 radio show “The Cats Roundtable” that it was very clear that former FBI Director James Comey hated President Donald Trump after he made it known he leaked memos.  He also urged Congress to act to abolish the independent counsel established by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged ties between the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Gingrich told host John Catsimatidis, “The more amazing thing I thought that Comey did that I think is going to have a lot of repercussions is Comey admitted publicly, in fact, boasted about it, that he had deliberately leaked   …     in order to set up the pressure to get a special, independent counsel. And I think that is an astonishing statement. ” “[I]t’s very clear that Comey hates Trump,” he continued. “I think Congress should now intervene and should abolish the independent counsel because Comey makes so clear that it’s the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking to the New York Times to deliberately set up this particular situation.

She could pick a running mate who would assure Bernie Sanders and his supporters that she heard his calls for progressive reforms, or she could pick a running mate who would help her win a general election. In Tim Kaine, she made an emphatic choice for the latter. Despite her insistence throughout the Democratic primary that she had found progressive religion    promising she was not beholden to Wall Street, embracing a $15 minimum wage (with caveats) shifting her position on the   Partnership, announcing   plans for   college    let it be known that Hillary Clinton is nothing if not a political creature, who puts politics first, principles second.  Unsurprisingly, Sanders’ supporters are not happy. A group of 1, 250 Sanders delegates called the Bernie Delegates Network surveyed its members and reported, according to the Boston Herald, that 89% found the selection of Kaine unacceptable. A spokesperson for the group, Jeff Cohen, said, ”The reaction of the choice of Kaine goes from disappointment to anger,” and he expected Sanders’ supporters to protest at the convention in Philadelphia. What is surprising, however, is that her detractors on the   seem caught off guard by Clinton’s      her embrace of a centrist Democrat who is   supports TPP,   drilling and spending cuts    after wrapping her figurative arms around Sanders throughout the primary. They shouldn’t be her life and career have been defined by her cunning penchant for making politically expedient choices.  But the   of that cynicism is a canny knack for political maneuverability and survivability, which she’s demonstrated time and again    winning a Senate race just months after her husband was impeached, turning a failed presidential run into a   Cabinet appointment, dodging charges for mishandling classified information. You could argue that politicians more wedded to their principles than their survival do not often last as long as she has or rise as far. Her veep pick epitomizes the ease with which she can separate the two. As a   old white male, Kaine speaks neither to the diversity wing of the Democratic party nor the millennials    essentially the heart of the Obama coalition    betraying many progressives’ hopes for a doubly ”historic” ticket: two women, for example, or a woman and a Hispanic. He does, however, speak to one of Clinton’s main deficiencies: blue collar,   white male Democrats who think the party has left them. And this political calculation is why she chose Kaine. The Democratic Party has been bleeding white men for years.   blue dog Democrats, moderates from swing states like Kaine, are a nearly extinct species. Many think the party’s progressive swing leftward, with a hyperfocus on social issues like contraception and transgender bathrooms, have locked blue collar, working white men out of the conversation, ignored in favor of courting every other kind of voter.  A Washington   News poll found that a whopping 75% of white men view Clinton unfavorably, and only 23% have a favorable view. Tim Kaine might be the kind of man they do like.  While veep selections are rarely consequential, Clinton’s own unfavorables are so high that her running mate could actually have a small impact. One Democratic strategist told me that Elizabeth Warren might have kept some Democrats home. Tim Kaine allows some to turn out.  Join us on Facebook. . As a Republican, I think her selection should be instructive. Far too often, conservatives prioritize purity over winning. You have to win an election to get your policies empowered. While we should all reject her naked dishonesty and shameful lack of accountability, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to win. Sanders’ supporters disappointment is understandable, but ultimately, to her, unimportant. ', 'Airplane manufacturer Boeing is set to start testing   vehicles according to new reports. [The Independent reports that Boeing will soon be testing   planes, possibly utilizing artificial intelligence to make decisions usually left up to human pilots. Boeing’s aim is to develop an aircraft that can operate entirely with minimal human interaction. Planes can already take off, cruise, and land without much interaction from human pilots, so the idea of a fully functioning artificial   plane is not too far fetched.  Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development, told Reuters, “When I look at the future I see a need for you know 41, 000 commercial jet airplanes over the course of the next 20 years. And that means we’re going to need something like six hundred and seventeen thousand more pilots. That’s a lot of pilots. ” He continued to say, “so one of the ways that may be solved is by having some type of autonomous behaviour and that could be anything from taking instead of five pilots on a long haul flight down to three or two, taking two pilots down to one in a freight situation, or in some cases going from one to none. ” “So one of the ways that may be solved is by having some type of autonomous behaviour and that could be anything from taking instead of five pilots on a long haul flight down to three or two, taking two pilots down to one in a freight situation, or in some cases going from one to none,” he explained. Starting this summer, Boeing will use advanced cockpit simulators used in the training of pilots to test the new   technology before implementing it in an actual aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only airplane manufacturer looking at automated travel: Airbus is currently working on   flying cars and will be testing   flying taxis by the end of 2017 with the aim of rolling out further access to the taxis in 2021. Airbus, however, is looking to develop an     system while Boeing seems to be focusing on long haul, large passenger flights.

[In an interview on Today Thursday morning, the new host of NBC’s Celebrity Apprentice  —   who stumped and voted for Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the primaries and later said he would not vote for Trump in the general election  —   said that now that the election is over, it is important to put divisions aside and come together for the good of the country.  “What changed is that now he is elected and now it is very important that we support the president and that we come together and we stop whining, and it becomes one nation,” Schwarzenegger told host Matt Lauer. Schwarzenegger said he was inspired by a letter that former President George H. W. Bush wrote to     Bill Clinton before he took office, in which the Republican wished his Democratic successor good luck, because it would mean the country was successful. “When someone is elected, then you get 100 percent behind them and you help them shape the future,” he said. “It’s very hard for people to do that, but that’s the effort we all have to make. ” When asked what piece of political advice he might give to the   Schwarzenegger urged Trump to “keep working with the other Party. ” “If you take people from both parties then you get 100 percent of the brainpower,” he said. “And there’s so much brainpower in the United States. This is by far the smartest country in the world, and the best country in the world. Now the trick of it is to go and make it even better. ” In the earlier portion of the interview, Schwarzenegger  —   who is due to take over on Celebrity Apprentice starting next year  —   defended Trump’s retention of an executive producer credit on the show. “I think it’s perfectly fine that he has the executive producer credit, because he created the show with Mark Burnett together, so why should his credit go? But he’s made it very clear that he has no interest in being involved.

On this occasion, it is urgent for us to reflect on 3 key lessons that the fall of the Evil Empire provided. They are lessons that the new incoming Trump administration must put into action immediately    our enemy in the terror war. [Lesson #1: Go on the Offense Against Islamic Supremacism,  While we know that the Soviet Union collapsed, on many realms, from within, the record is clear that President Reagan also fueled the collapse. By moving against détente and beyond containment, Reagan’s aggressive   saw the U. S. take on a strategic offensive against the Soviet Union which led to victory. As Paul Kengor has documented in his book, The Crusader, Reagan fought not to just contain, but to win. His administration’s massive defense   support of   rebels around the world, support of dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain, promotion of SDI, and many other aggressive policies put a heavy pressure on the Soviet Union that ultimately broke its already fragile legs. Thus, we see how in our   conflict with Islamic Supremacism, we need to go on the offensive. In order to do that, we must first take two crucial steps. The first step is to name the enemy the second is to formulate an actual doctrine against him. As Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad, the U. S. government needs to lay down a vision, an actual “threat doctrine analysis” in a thorough document, just like George Kennan’s Long Telegram and   did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War. The new incoming Trump administration, therefore, must articulate a threat doctrine analysis and then shape it into a   doctrine of offense. Lesson #2: Deceive the Totalitarian Enemy into Being Pluralistic, In Reagan’s War, Peter Schweizer revealed how the Reagan administration cleverly promoted the process of change within the Soviet Union towards a more pluralistic political and economic system. This was a brilliant approach, seeing that Gorbachev’s policies of Glasnost and Perestroika clearly triggered communism’s collapse. Henry Kissinger has shrewdly delineated how Gorbachev’s effort to reform, as well as to salvage, Soviet communism was the very ingredient that fueled its disintegration. Indeed, once Moscow ended its total and intrusive control of its satellites, and once it allowed free discussion, it signed its own death warrant. Gorbachev wanted to   yet he could not do so without destroying the regime itself. Kissinger writes: Gorbachev’s gamble on liberalization was bound to fail. To the degree that the Communist Party had lost its monolithic character, it became demoralized. Liberalization proved incompatible with communist rule  —   the communists could not turn themselves into democrats without ceasing to be communists, an equation Gorbachev never understood. To be sure, the whole idea of   was based on the assumption that the Soviet regime could survive without its despotic component that it could endure a reconciliation with its past. But a legitimate examination of the causes of Stalinism could not occur without an uncensored evaluation of Leninism, which the Soviet system could not allow without risking the   of its entire foundation. This is a crucial lesson for our leadership in the terror war. But first, let us be clear: we must not buy into Natan Sharansky’s naive assumption that all people want freedom. They do not, especially  . The dark consequences of the   “Arab Spring” taught us this painful lesson well, as we witnessed the process of “democratization” in the Middle East lead to a totalitarian Islamist Winter. But this does not mean that we do not heed one of Sharansky’s profound implications: that we must follow Reagan’s example of undermining the enemy by encouraging certain tyrannical entities to behave like pluralists. There is huge potential in nudging tyrants to open up free discussion and to hold their terror back  —   for freedom and spoken truth have a corrosive effect on tyranny’s chains. Indeed, just imagine, for instance, if leaders within the Islamic world started showing off how pluralistic they were and began allowing a free and honest discussion on the ingredients of their prophet Mohammed’s life. Lesson #3: Verbally Take the Moral High Ground, In his June 1982 speech before the British House of Commons, President Reagan announced that he had a   plan “which will leave   on the ash heap of history. ” The next year, on March 8, 1983, he famously called the Soviet Union the “Evil Empire. ” Four years later, in June 1987, he challenged Gorbachev to “tear down” the Berlin Wall. All of these pronouncements were crucial in the U. S. strategy of defeating Soviet communism. They upped the stakes and achieved moral clarity. They cut the dividing line between the good guys and the bad guys, and they called out the Soviets for the evil oppressors that they were. In so doing, these pronouncements also made it clear that the future was not on the Soviets’ side. William F. Buckley, Jr. profoundly noted that by calling the Soviet Union the “Evil Empire,” Reagan had formulated the galvanizing summation to Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago and, consequently, “the countdown for Communism began then. ” And indeed, two years after challenging Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, the wall came down. The lesson here for the new incoming president is that the moral difference between our side and Islamic Supremacism must be spoken. The divide must be drawn in no uncertain terms. President Trump can be most effective in this regard by bringing attention to all the victims of Sharia and Jihad, and emphasizing that Muslims are also the victims of Islamic Supremacism. One of the most urgent causes to promote is the women’s rights issue. American leadership must make it transparently clear, once and for all, which civilization stands for women and what entity denigrates and mutilates them. Trump must deliver a special speech that unveils the victims of honor killings, acid attacks and female genital mutilation, and of forced veiling, forced marriage and forced segregation under Islam  —   and issue a concrete challenge as Reagan did to Gorbachev. He must point to the tyrannical wall of Islamic gender apartheid and pronounce unequivocally: Imams, muftis and clerics of the world, tear down this wall. Trump must do this while simultaneously shattering the Left’s and Muslim Brotherhood’s favorite propaganda lie: that standing up to Islamic Supremacism and telling the truth about its inspirations is somehow instigating hatred of all Muslim people. This is a pernicious ploy based on a faulty conflation of Islam with Muslims. It must be made categorically clear that we are dealing with an ideology we are not hating all the people who fall under its grasp. There are millions of people who go under the label “Muslim” but who may not agree with, or follow, all Islamic mandates, or who may want to reform them, or who may not even know anything about them  —   or who may have simply been born into the religion and were never even given a choice as to who they wanted to be. We have no problem with these people. And as a matter of fact, our standing up to Islamic Supremacism is a defense of these Muslims because they are, like millions of Muslims around the world, also victims of Islamic Supremacism. All in all, the point must be driven home that we are on the side of Muslim people, and especially of those, like Zuhdi Jasser, who seek to reform Islam and bring it into the modern world. And so, in reflecting on these three lessons of the fall of the Soviet Union 25 years ago, we begin to gauge how, if applied with precision, they can help our new incoming president launch a winning strategy against our enemy in the terror war. Trump shows every sign that he can and will achieve this. He has demonstrated himself to be a good man who loves his country and who wants the best for it. He has shown a willingness to name the enemy and to take the war to him. He has also surrounded himself with all the noble and   people who are determined to set America on the winning course. If all these pieces fall into place, President Trump will succeed, as Reagan did, in setting the stage for yet another glorious chapter  —   a chapter that sees an Evil Empire stagger to its knees and then, when finally shamed and crippled, cast where it belongs: on the ash heap of history.

No,”   House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday during his weekly press   briefing. ”That’’s not how you stop terrorism.” ’ ’   Democratic  of Connecticut  among others, have insisted   that due process elements would be ”baked into it.” ’ ’   The Cornyn bill, backed by Senate Republicans and the NRA, was a   slightly altered version of the Shield Act proposed by the   senator last year that failed.

Troy Gilbert    for the third time. Ten years ago, Troy was flying in the skies over Iraq when he received a distress call about a Special Operations unit whose helicopter had crashed and was now being ambushed by enemy forces. His wingman had flown off to refuel and the friendly forces on the ground were too close to the enemy to safely drop a bomb. So he flew dangerously low, strafing the enemy with his Gatling gun.  ”(Troy) wasn’t going to look like he was doing something, he was actually going to do something,” Ginger said.   One pass went as planned and he took out an enemy truck. But on his next pass, he couldn’t pull the jet up in time and it crashed. Troy died instantly.  Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, who led the investigation into Troy’s crash, said he wrote the accident report knowing Troy’s children would read it one day. ”(Troy) was so intensely focused on taking that target out, saving American lives, that he didn’t give himself enough room for the recovery,” Goldfein told CNN’s Barbara Starr.  Troy left behind Ginger and their five children, including twin    girls.  ’Something terrible had happened’ The knock at the door came without warning. ”I just looked out and saw that sea of blue Air Force uniforms,” Ginger said, ”And I looked at their faces and I knew something terrible had happened.”  Not only had Troy been killed in action, but the family learned that insurgents had found his body, taken it and used it in online propaganda videos.  Scouring the crash site, investigators were able to recover skull fragments that they identified through DNA as his. Ginger decided to hold his 2006 funeral with a   but empty, coffin.  Years passed. As propaganda video continued to surface, the family fought to scrub them from the Internet. Meanwhile, Ginger still pushed the Air Force to find Troy’s body    all of it. During that time, the family found ways to remember Troy. On the anniversary of his death, they make his favorite food    brownies    and release balloons with   messages on them.  A few years ago, someone turned over some bones from Troy’s toes to the Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad. After another DNA confirmation, the family held funeral number two in 2013. ”It was very spiritually symbolic to me that all we had was the very top of his head and the very tip of his toes,” Ginger said.  There were days she thought they’d never recover the rest of him, but in August, Ginger finally received the phone call she had been waiting for. She was informed that ”Troy’s been found. And I was . .. I was blown away,” she said, her voice breaking. The very same unit Troy had saved recovered his body in Iraq after a local warlord claimed he had it.   A new beginning, Ginger’s strong faith was shaken by Troy’s loss, but her spirits were boosted by an email a stranger wrote about his wife’s battle with breast cancer that was forwarded to her.  She tracked the couple down and traded emails with them. They helped each other cope. The wife eventually passed away, and when Ginger by chance was spending the holidays near the couple’s home, she arranged to meet the widower, Jim Ravella, face to face. Eventually, their mutual grief turned to love and they wed a few months later. He adopted all five Gilbert children on Memorial Day in 2009. Jim not only understood what Ginger was going through, he understood Troy.  Himself a retired Air Force pilot who flew   Jim was able to follow the crash report like few others could. The couple is now writing a book about faith, loss and love. They work together for Folds of Honor, a charity that helps children who have lost a parent receive an education. As part of that, Ginger tells Troy’s story to audiences across the country.  ”Gold Star families, we just want their name to still be spoken and their lives to still be relevant,” Ginger explained. ”And his life is very relevant, very relevant. He’s still helping people. Which is exactly what he wanted to be doing.” The family periodically watches a   video Troy recorded in Iraq just before he died. On it, he reads Bible verses to the children, tells them how much he loves them and promises to return home. While it won’t be the reunion they all imagined, after 10 years, his homecoming will finally happen.  ', 'It’s been another good year for Navy football. Even after last week’s loss to Temple in the American Athletic Conference’s title game, the Midshipmen are   with victories over Notre Dame and Houston. They are favored to beat archrival Army on Saturday for the 15th consecutive year. And two days before Christmas, Navy will end its season by playing Louisiana Tech in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl, which has a payout of $600, 000 per team. This season is not an anomaly. The United States Naval Academy may not be Alabama or Michigan, but it plays a serious brand of Division I football. Last year, the Blue and Gold went   soundly defeating the University of Pittsburgh in the Military Bowl ($1 million payout for each team). In 2014, the team was   including a   victory over San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl ($750, 000 payout). Its 2013 record was   with a   win . .. well, you get the picture. The last time Navy had a losing season was 2011. But how does Navy do it? Aren’t there height and weight restrictions that would limit the Midshipmen’s ability to recruit the kind of athletes you need to succeed in Division I football? (There are.) Isn’t the federal government stingy in giving tax dollars to the military academies for athletics? (It is.) Aren’t the academies, charged with training the nation’s military leadership, supposed to maintain their admissions and academic standards even if it means passing on football players? (Yep.) And aren’t Naval Academy graduates required to put in five years of military service after graduation, which would seem to preclude attracting athletes with pro potential? (Yes again.) The Naval Academy will tell you that because athletics is such an important part of the school’s culture  —   it has 33 varsity teams, and every midshipman on campus plays a sport, even if it’s intramurals  —   that it naturally attracts good athletes. Plus, there’s that Navy spirit. As Dorse DuBois, a Naval Academy alumnus, put it recently on Facebook: “Football is a polite and unarmed version of warfare, played as though there’s no second place. ” He added: “Yeah, we’re a small school, our players are usually smaller, too. But we’re very physical, very disciplined and approach every game with the urgency required to win a battle. ” There is some merit to both rationales, but I’d also like to suggest a third possibility: Navy’s gaming the system. For instance, have you ever heard of the Naval Academy Preparatory School, or NAPS as it’s called? In Newport, R. I. close to the Naval War College, NAPS was founded in 1915 as a place where enlisted men with officer potential could get up to speed academically before entering the Naval Academy. By the late 1960s, NAPS had opened its doors to civilians. This was partly a diversity effort, but it was also a way to get in the children of alumni or politicians who didn’t have the grades or SAT scores to be admitted into the Naval Academy directly from high school. Once in NAPS, which is   students were essentially guaranteed a spot in the Naval Academy the next year. According to a Naval Academy spokesman, Cmdr. David McKinney, the prep school costs taxpayers around $14 million a year. In the 1980s, Navy noticed that the Air Force Academy, which was regularly trouncing it in football, was placing recruited athletes in its prep school. Indeed, in 2003, Fisher DeBerry, the longtime coach of the Falcons, told The Colorado Springs Gazette that the prep school “has had a major impact on the success of our football team. ” Eager to turn the tide against its rival, Navy began to copy DeBerry’s methods. Sure enough, NAPS is now a means by which Navy launders underqualified athletes into the Naval Academy. Jim Kenney, a retired Navy captain who was the commanding officer of the Navy prep school from   recalled that in his era maybe four football players had been enrolled. “Today,” he said, “it is dominated by athletes. ” McKinney says that recruited athletes made up only 35 percent of the current NAPS class. But their effect on Navy athletics is huge.   percent of the current football team got into the Naval Academy through NAPS, according to the Midshipmen football media guide. More than half the men’s basketball team went to NAPS, and 60 percent of the women’s basketball team. There have been years when 80 percent of the lacrosse team’s players were NAPS graduates. In addition to a free education, the Navy gives NAPS students $1, 000 a month. Ordinarily, this would be a violation of N. C. A. A. rules. Because NAPS students are being paid for being in the military, the N. C. A. A. has granted a waiver allowing the stipend. (The same is true at the Air Force and Army prep schools.) What was NAPS like for the athletes? The athletics were intense, and the academics none too stressful, recalled Peter Banos, who played basketball there in 2008. “There was all sorts of tutoring,” he said, “but really, it was like another year of high school. ” Banos added: “We had cars, we could visit friends, and we were flush with cash. It was high school kids getting paid. ” And if, after a year at NAPS, a student decided not to go the academy, the Navy didn’t ask for its money back. Banos left the Naval Academy after his freshman year. The Naval Academy said that many NAPS athletes go on to succeed at the academy and in the Navy. Three former Navy football players from the class of 1998, all of whom went through NAPS, are in important command posts seeking terrorists. There is a second way that Navy lands athletes who would normally be rejected through the admissions process. The Naval Academy Foundation, an entity founded in 1944 to support Navy athletics, pays for scholarships to send athletes to a private prep school, usually one with a heavy emphasis on sports. In return, the athletes are expected to go to the Naval Academy the next year. The donors to the foundation are almost all Naval Academy alumni. Let’s dwell on this for a second. Imagine if some Ohio State boosters paid to send recruited athletes to a private prep school for a year before they went to the university. It would be an    scandal  —   exactly the kind of booster bribery the N. C. A. A. wants to stamp out. Yet, once again, the military academies have been given a waiver by the association. Those height and weight restrictions I mentioned earlier? They are waived for athletes  —   at least until their eligibility is used up. At that point, those 280 pounds that made a Navy lineman so valuable to the team become a huge liability. They are suddenly under tremendous pressure to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds, depending on their height. And if they don’t  —   or simply can’t  —   their careers suffer, and sometimes end prematurely. As for that required five years of military service, there once was a time when even the best Navy athletes had to put in time after graduation before going on to a professional career. Roger Staubach, who won the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 1963, didn’t join the Dallas Cowboys until 1969. His Navy tour included a year in Vietnam. Recently, athletes good enough to become professionals haven’t had to put in five years of military service. In May, the secretary of the Navy granted waivers to four Navy athletes, allowing them to play while serving in the Reserve. They included Keenan Reynolds, last season’s quarterback, who is now with the Baltimore Ravens, and Joe Cardona, who is the long snapper for the New England Patriots. The good news, I suppose, is that, aside from the cost of NAPS, Navy athletics doesn’t cost the taxpayer very much money. The government allocates only $3. 9 million to the Navy athletic department. The rest of Navy’s athletic budget comes from an organization called the Naval Academy Athletic Association. Although the N. A. A. A. describes itself as a “nongovernment agency,” the majority of its board members are Naval Academy personnel, including Chet Gladchuk, the athletic director. Its offices are on campus. It uses the Naval Academy’s email system. And so on. And it doesn’t just finance the athletic department. It runs it. The N. A. A. A. employs and pays the coaches. (Navy’s football coach, Ken Niumatalolo, makes $1. 6 million.) It manages the stadium. It negotiates the media contracts. And it rustles up sponsors. In all, Navy’s athletic budget is over $40 million, in the same range as the budgets at Hawaii, Boise State and New Mexico. Are the compromises Navy makes to remain competitive in   college football any worse than other Division I schools? Not really. But that’s not the point. The military academies do something critical for our nation: They “train and educate junior officers in the Navy and Marine Corps,” said Barry Relinger, a Naval Academy alumnus. “They should be dedicated to that purpose and not trying to achieve greatness of Division I sports. ” No one is saying sports shouldn’t matter at the Naval Academy. The Navy believes that sports can build character and imbue leadership qualities that are important for officers. I’m not going to disagree. But to its critics, the gamesmanship required for the Naval Academy to be able to play football competitively with the likes of Notre Dame has hurt its ability to turn out the best officers possible. “I think competition is very important,” said David Tuma, an alumnus who has long been critical of Navy athletics. “But you don’t have to be in Division I to stir the competitive spirit. ” On Saturday afternoon, the annual   game will be a   patriotic spectacle. It will be fun to watch. Would we feel any different about it if the two schools didn’t park athletes in their prep schools? If the linemen weighed 230 instead of 280? If they were in Division III instead of Division I? I doubt it. If only the Navy believed that.', 'Leftist groups and government officials are pressuring pregnant women in the Americas to disregard the sanctity of life in response to the   Zika virus and abort children diagnosed with brain deformities tied to the virus. [In   countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, a region where abortion is very difficult, if not illegal, the virus outbreak has sparked a debate over the permissibility of abortion in pregnant women infected with the virus, which has been linked to a neurological disorder known as microcephaly that makes it especially dangerous to pregnant women and their babies.  Microcephaly is a birth defect that causes babies to be born with smaller heads than normal and often have developmental problems. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned pregnant American women and females of childbearing age who may become pregnant against traveling to most countries in the Americas where the Zika virus has spread. CDC lists 24 countries and territories with active Zika virus transmissions, including 22 located in the Americas: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, US Virgin Islands and Venezuela. “In many of these countries it is very difficult, if not impossible, for women who are already pregnant to get an abortion,” reports the Guardian. In Brazil, the   country, an editorial published by O Globo uses the “national calamity” to push mothers to disregard the sanctity of life, a position that has been emulated in editorials across Latin America. “It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,” argues the editorial by sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy, expressing a view point similar to that of the United Nations, which believes abortion is a human right. In Brazil, one of the most   countries in the world, the practice is only allowed to save the pregnant women’s life and in case of rape or incest, reports the Guardian, citing the Center for Reproductive Rights, Amnesty, and Human Rights Watch. At least one judge in the country has announced he would allow abortions for women who can prove their children will be born with microcephaly and that they have the Zika virus inside them. “The current epidemiological context urgently demands a public debate in the republic, plural and respectful of the right to abortion, anchored in the parameters of choice versus authoritarian imposition,” argues the O Globo. Leftist Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is reportedly engaging religious leaders as part of her government’s campaign against Zika to help increase awareness and prevention of the disease. Religious leaders there have not yet remarked on efforts to promote abortion in light of the Zika outbreak. Colombia, a traditionally   country that has arguably been pushed leftwards by current President Juan Manuel Santos, has been the second   country, according to the Associated Press (AP). There, Fernando Ruiz, the deputy health minister, has said pregnant women suspected of being infected by Zika can have legal access to an abortion if they can prove that the fetus has the neurological disorder microcephaly, reports Radio Nacional de Colombia. “Colombia’s penal code prohibits abortion in all circumstances, though the penalty is substantially lower where the pregnancy is the result of rape or   artificial insemination,” reports the Guardian. In an editorial published by online news outlet El Faro, which covers Latin America, author Laura Aguirre, a doctoral student in sociology at the Institute of Latin American Studies at the Free University of Berlin, ridicules the suggestion by the government of El Salvador for women to abstain from getting pregnant until 2017 to avoid the Zika virus in the country, and suggests that they should be granted access to abortion instead. El Faro notes that Aguirre’s college thesis was “framed within feminist critical perspectives. ” In El Salvador, “abortion is illegal with no explicit exception to save a woman’s life, with legislation for exceptions having been abolished,” explains the Guardian. Monica Roa, a spokesman for Women’s Link Worldwide, a   NGO, described restrictive abortion laws in Brazil, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic as a “gap in sexual education. ” She indicated that recommendations to postpone pregnancies are “unrealistic,” suggesting that abortions are a better option because most pregnancies in the region are unplanned. Puerto Rico, where the transmission the disease has been detected, is not immune to the abortion debate shaping up across Latin America. Health authorities in the U. S. territory have avoided entering the debate, argues a news reporter in the Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Dia. The article quotes Dr. Brenda Rivera Garcia, director of the Epidemiology division at the Department of Health in Puerto Rico, as saying that “on the question of allowing abortions in cases where fetuses are identified with microcephaly  …    it would be very difficult, particularly because the scans performed to identify the disorder are carried out late in gestation. ” “Under US constitutional law, which applies in Puerto Rico, abortion is permitted provided the fetus is not viable, or if the woman’s health is at risk,” points out the Guardian. “However, Puerto Rico also has a criminal statute on the books which prohibits abortions except to protect a woman’s health, a crime punishable by two years’ imprisonment. It is not clear which law supersedes the other. ”', '        This article is part of a feature we also send out via email as The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter with stories, ideas, and images from The Atlantic, written specially for subscribers.

The Russia Report: The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released a declassified version of its report on Russian interference with the U. S. election, following a Senate hearing on the subject yesterday. The report concludes that while hackers did not attempt to meddle directly with vote counts, the Russian government did order a series of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns in order to help Donald Trump win the election. However, it doesn’t make any new evidence public, and it’s unlikely to sway any of those who still doubt Russia’s role —  including Trump himself. The  ’s friendliness toward Russia sets him apart from most members of his own party as well as from Democrats. But he’s not alone among other populist leaders in Europe, who see Russian President Vladimir Putin as a   for conservative values as well as for goals like fighting ISIS and reducing dependence on global trade. Working Knowledge: The final jobs report of 2016 (and of the Obama presidency) was released today by the Labor Department, which found that December completed a record 75 months of job growth. Such growth has been a major accomplishment of Obama’s time in office, but jobs —  and particularly the loss of careers in manufacturing —  are also a big source of Trump supporters’ dissatisfaction with the outgoing president. Why the disconnect? A visit to one factory in Indiana shows flaws in both sides of the narrative: Manufacturing jobs are actually increasing in some specialized fields, but they require more education than similar jobs have had in the past. Meanwhile, some companies are canceling promised raises for their workers, as an executive order that would have raised the threshold for overtime pay looks like it may never get implemented. Banking Business: As Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin prepares for a new job in the Trump administration, documents from the very department he’s been chosen to lead are casting doubt on his record, showing that in 2011, Mnuchin’s bank —  OneWest in California —  was accused by Treasury Department regulators of mishandling foreclosures. Also troubling: A new investigation by the Wall Street Journal shows that Trump owes business debt to more than 150 financial institutions, creating a web of conflicts of interest that could prove nearly impossible to navigate.

Answers: parasites, norway, metal, Over at the TAD forum, Atlantic readers discussed Clare Foran’s latest piece, “The Democrats Face a Daunting Future. ” The most   comment: Democrats need to resist Trump without calling Trump’s voters morons. Based on my Facebook feed, this may be very difficult for some of them to do. Another reader notes: In 2009, Republicans only controlled 14 state legislatures. [Now they control 33, a legislative dominance not seen since the Civil War.] Certainly the 2010 redistricting and gerrymandering had an effect, but the state of the local Dem party is not too far out of whack from what should be expected after eight years of a Democratic president. I’ll say that Republicans are traditionally very good at nationalizing local races. But following Trump’s victory, not being the White House incumbent party should help Democrats on its own.

[Trump, who canceled his appearance at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to continue campaigning before Super Saturday’s caucuses, looks to strike in Marco Rubio’s home state of Florida.  Trump is expected to speak at 2:45 Eastern time. Two hours before the event was set to begin, supporters were already filling up the arena. Supporters still outside the arena are reportedly being turned away by the fire marshal with the building filled to capacity: Inside, supporters and media pack the arena as they wait for Donald Trump to take the stage:', 'WASHINGTON  —   The Pentagon said on Monday that it had sent 15 Guantánamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates in the largest single transfer of the Obama administration. The move eliminated a fifth of the wartime prison’s remaining population, which dropped to 61. While it appears increasingly unlikely that President Obama will succeed in closing the prison before he leaves office in January, the transfer brought him significantly closer to another goal: getting out every detainee who has been approved for transfer. Some have been stranded on that list for years because they could not be repatriated. The detainees sent to the United Arab Emirates included 12 Yemenis and three Afghans. The United States had held each of them without trial for about 14 years. Their departure reduced the list of prisoners approved for transfer to 20 men, although a   review board occasionally adds new names to it. “The United States is grateful to the government of the United Arab Emirates for its continued assistance in closing the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay,” Lee Wolosky, the State Department special envoy who negotiates such transfers, said in a statement. The Obama administration has made a sustained diplomatic push to persuade Persian Gulf states to resettle detainees from troubled countries like Yemen. American security officials see them as attractive places to send such detainees both because they share the same language and culture, and because they have security agencies with the capacity to monitor them. Oman was the first gulf country to provide such help, agreeing to resettle 10   detainees in two batches in early and  . At a meeting in May 2015 at Camp David with leaders or representatives from the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Mr. Obama sought to leverage that deal by urging others to help out, too, officials said. The United Arab Emirates resettled five Yemenis last November. It put them into a modified version of a custodial rehabilitation program it had developed for its own citizens who had been drawn into Islamist extremism, according to officials familiar with the transfer. In January, Oman resettled another group of 10. And in April, Saudi Arabia resettled nine. Qatar has taken on a different headache: In 2014, it resettled five   Taliban prisoners whom the administration exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Those former prisoners continue to live there under restrictive conditions. The transfers announced Monday were approved by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. Under restrictions imposed by Congress, he must tell lawmakers at least 30 days before any transfer that he has determined that security conditions in the receiving country are adequate. One of the detainees in Monday’s transfer, an Afghan named Obaydullah, was arrested in 2002 and accused of hiding   mines for an insurgent cell. Late in the Bush administration, he was charged in the military commissions system with providing material support for terrorism, although the charge was later withdrawn for technical reasons. His defense team later visited Afghanistan and reinvestigated his case, developing what it said in 2012 was evidence that the accusations against him were mistaken, although the team failed to persuade a court to order his release. Last spring, however, the review board decided that he should be sent to a country with a strong reintegration program and monitoring capacity. “In making this determination, the board noted that the detainee has not expressed any intent to   in terrorist activities, has not espoused any  . S. sentiment that would indicate he views the U. S. as his enemy, that neither the detainee nor his family have any ties to extremists outside of Guantánamo, and that the detainee has been mostly compliant while at Guantánamo,” the review board explained in a report. Maj. Derek A. Poteet of the Marines, a military lawyer who helped represent Mr. Obaydullah, said he visited his client at the prison about three weeks ago. Mr. Obaydullah had already heard a rumor that the United Arab Emirates had agreed to resettle him, he said. “He had hope on his face and relief when I was able to confirm that hope,” Major Poteet said. “My paralegal and I were in there, and he reassured us that ‘I want to live a life of peace with my family, and I want nothing to do with politics. ’” When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, 242 detainees remained at Guantánamo. He has proposed closing it by bringing several dozen detainees who are not approved for transfer to a replacement prison on domestic soil. But Congress has blocked that plan, and some Republican lawmakers have proposed shutting down transfers of   detainees to other countries, too. “The   responsibility of the federal government is to keep the American people safe, yet the Obama administration’s misguided commitment to releasing detainees in order to eventually close Guantánamo unacceptably gambles with our nation’s safety,” Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, said last week.', 'Former President Bill Clinton’s   in his tense interaction with Black Lives Matter protesters today by praising his wife’s work to save lives in Africa, adding that it is “a place where Black Lives Matter. ”  “I’ll tell you another story about a place where Black Lives Matter: Africa,” Clinton said. “The other day, I started my day with a picture that was sent to me on my iPad of a little guy running a store —  he wasn’t very tall —  in Tanzania in Dar es Salaam.

ET] A Western Intelligence source tells CNN that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 to 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The source said that European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies identified an ”imminent threat” to Belgium, possibly also to the Netherlands. [Previous story, posted at 8 p. m. ET] Belgian operation thwarted ’major terrorist attacks’ (CNN)    A terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack was the target of a raid Thursday that left two suspects dead, Belgian authorities said. A third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation at a building in the eastern city of Verviers, prosecutor’s spokesman Thierry Werts told reporters. A senior Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from ISIS. Some members of the cell had traveled to Syria and met with ISIS, which plotted the attacks as retaliation for U. S.  airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, the Belgian source said.  ”This was in the framework of an operation looking into an operational cell made up of people, some of whom coming back from Syria,” Werts said. ”The investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in Belgium imminently.” The operation, which authorities said was ongoing, added fresh fuel to a fear that’s been simmering for months as thousands of Europeans went off to join ISIS fighters in Syria. Would they bring the war back with them when they returned home?  Gunfire rang out as authorities closed in, Frédéric Hausman was inside his house in Verviers when he heard the explosions start. From the window, he saw police officers firing assault rifles at a house nearby. He watched smoke rising after another explosion went off. Then, police entered the house, Hausman told CNN’s ”Erin Burnett OutFront.” And even though he couldn’t see exactly what happened next, he heard it. ”I can hear it. Everybody can hear it,” Hausman said. ”In this little city, everybody heard the sound.” Shouts, gunfire and the sound of glass shattering echo in a video Hausman posted on YouTube. ”The suspects immediately, and for long minutes, fired using weapons and hand weapons before being neutralized,” Werts said.   Verviers is about 69 miles (111 kilometers)   of Brussels and 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of Paris, where terrorist attacks last week heightened alerts in Europe. CNN affiliate VTM reported that the terrorism investigation in Belgium started weeks ago, and there has been no connection established with the Paris attacks. A Western intelligence source said the Paris attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the Belgian operation. One reason: The arrest of a Belgian arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to Amedy Coulibaly,  the man who attacked a Paris kosher supermarket and also pledged allegiance to ISIS. Belgian investigators questioned him and searched his possessions, the source said. Through the arms dealer, the investigators got a number of ”positive hits” on suspected extremists already known to authorities. But in the wake of the Paris attacks, the source said, it stepped up the urgency. The trio targeted in the Verviers raid had been under surveillance for some time, Werts said.  Additional   operations are underway in other cities, the Belgian counterterrorism official said.  Shift in strategy for ISIS? In recent weeks, European security services received indications of an ominous possibility: that ISIS may have started directing European extremists in Syria and Iraq to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries, the Belgian counterterrorism official said.  Security agencies in several European countries were intensely investigating several groups of returnees from Syria and Iraq, the official said, including the group that authorities confronted in Belgium.  The Belgian counterterrorism official said indications of ISIS ordering attacks in Europe mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group. Before the air campaign against it, the official said, there was little indication ISIS leaders were directly plotting attacks in the West. Instead, the group prioritized its project to create an Islamic caliphate.  The official named France, the UK and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat. Counterterrorism agencies in Germany also are on high alert because of the number of fighters who have traveled. Several European countries, including Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. Why would ISIS change tack? Partly because of increased competition between ISIS and al Qaeda affiliates, including the Khorasan group in Syria, to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad, according to the official.    The official said there is also significant concern about Khorasan attack plotting against Europe. U. S. officials previously told CNN that French al Qaeda operative and   David Drugeon was suspected to be   European jihadis in Syria for operations in Europe. Drugeon was injured in a drone strike in November but is believed to be still alive.  Last week, Andrew Parker, the head of Britain’s security service MI5, warned, ”A group of core al Qaeda terrorists in Syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the West,” an apparent reference to the Khorasan group. Returning fighters implicated in other attacks, European officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by returning fighters. More than 3, 000 Europeans have left to fight in Syria in recent years. The total number who have returned to Europe is estimated to be over 500, including 250 who have returned to the UK, almost 200 to France and about 70 to Belgium. Several returning ISIS fighters have already been implicated in attack plans in Europe. In February, police in Cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in France by Ibrahim Boudina, a   extremist who allegedly had just returned from fighting with ISIS in Syria. Police said they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive TATP inside soda cans in his family’s Cannes apartment building. Screws and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel, according to sources briefed on the investigation. Boudina has denied the allegations against him. Mehdi Nemmouche, a   ISIS fighter who allegedly helped guard Western hostages in Syria before returning to Europe, allegedly shot and killed four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in May. Nemmouche was arrested in France and extradited to face trial in Belgium. He has denied the charges. In both the Cannes and Brussels plots, investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam. No evidence has been publicly released suggesting ISIS leadership signed off on the plots. But the worry now is that ISIS has pivoted toward launching attacks in Europe.  European officials say all this adds up to an unprecedented terrorist threat in Europe. Late last year, just weeks before the attacks on a satirical magazine, Jewish grocery and police officers in Paris, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said France had never faced a greater terrorist threat.  ISIS runs large training facilities in Syria, has deep financial pockets, and access to thousands of potential European recruits. ', 'Border Patrol agents working near the border community of Havana, Texas, rescued a woman who had crossed the border from Mexico and was abandoned by her smugglers, left to die. [U. S. Border Patrol agents from the Rio Grande Valley Sector were working near the town of Havana when they encountered a woman suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration. The woman was unconscious and had been left to die by her human smugglers, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from the Border Patrol. Havana is located just west of Mission, Texas, just a few miles from the border with Mexico.  One of the agents, trained as an emergency medical technician, provided aid to the woman while other agents called for an ambulance. She was transported by ambulance to an area hospital in McAllen. She was expected to recover after medical treatment and evaluation. The woman will then be processed by the Border Patrol station in McAllen. Later that day, Border Patrol agents engaged in a pursuit when a vehicle fled from the Sarita Checkpoint on Highway 77, south of Kingsville. A   agent alerted to the trunk area of the vehicle and the driver took off. As is normally the case in south Texas, the pursuit lasted a short time and the driver eventually stopped and was arrested. Agents searched the vehicle and found seven illegal aliens packed into the trunk of the car. The smuggling cargo of human beings was trapped inside the trunk with no way to escape the sweltering heat. Temperatures in the area were approaching the 100 degree mark. Illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America are frequently abused by the cartel connected human smugglers who are happy to take their cash but care little for their safety or  . Breitbart Texas has reported frequently on deaths in the south Texas counties where the bodies or skeletal remains of these immigrants are found after they have been abandoned by their smugglers.

Trump shared his thoughts about the political press and Harambe, the gorilla that Cincinnati Zoo officials shot and killed after a small child wandered into his enclosure. Mr. Trump had nicer things to say about the gorilla. The news conference  —   which Mr. Trump called to defend himself over questions about   for veterans’ charities  —   was a textbook example of the candidate’s need to devour media attention and deplore it at the same time. The offense reporters committed this time: asking whether the money he said he had raised at a January benefit  —   organized in place of a Fox News debate he was skipping  —   had really made it to the beneficiaries, and if so, how much. A candidate said he would do a thing reporters tried to confirm whether he had. (Last week The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump had not yet made his own donation.) This, to Mr. Trump, was an outrage, an affront, not very nice treatment at all. He said he had not wanted to claim credit for his deeds  —   which he promoted, allowed to be covered on television and referred to during the campaign  —   but the nosy press had forced his hand. So he showed up at the news conference with a list of donations and recipients, as well as a list of grievances. Tom Llamas, a reporter from ABC News, was a “sleaze,” he said Jim Acosta, of CNN, “a real beauty. ” The event, carried live on the major cable networks, showed how Mr. Trump uses his media omnipresence to control his message. By railing at the questions, he was able to send a headline to voters, repeated on the chyrons  —   that the candidate raised money for vets  —   while mostly pushing past questions of when he did it and whether his earlier claims had been truthful at the time he made them. The reporters pushed back, pressing Mr. Trump not just on the donations but also on his continued attacks against detractors in the Republican Party, on his   on whether he is too   for the presidency. Mr. Trump, of course, believes that his skin, like all other parts of him, is fine as it is. And he essentially promised that, should he be elected, this news conference would be a preview of White House press room sessions to come. Mr. Trump may dish out abuse to the press, but at least he’s a source of constant quotes. His likely fall opponent, Hillary Clinton, is more polite but also more guarded. (Or as a New York magazine profile by Rebecca Traister this week bluntly put it, “Clinton hates the press” —   even if she doesn’t pummel them for the cameras.) This relative silence has helped Mr. Trump dominate airtime and make the news cycle his    mirror. Mrs. Clinton has lately tried to fill the vacuum by doing more interviews Tuesday afternoon, she phoned in,   to Jake Tapper on CNN and Chris Hayes on MSNBC. Both of them led their interviews by asking her what she thought of Mr. Trump’s news conference. Mr. Trump is not the first candidate to bash the news media while craving its attention. He’s just made the contradiction, like everything he builds, bigger and gaudier. He’s collected, by a New York Times estimate, $2 billion in free media. And he attacks, mocks and threatens news outlets when they aren’t “nice,” building bona fides with a voter base that has been encouraged for decades to see Big Media as the enemy. He can   journalists, then turn peevish and furious. The whole impetus for the news conference, remember, was an event he held when he was angry at Fox News. Now he has nothing but nice things to say about Fox News, because he’s sewn up the nomination, and the network has become very, very nice to him. And then there came the question about Harambe, because it is 2016, and this is what we do now: We ask the reality TV star who may become the leader of the free world how tough he would be on large zoo animals. It was poetically fitting. For almost a year, Mr. Trump has been the   gorilla whose unpredictable rampages have obsessed the news media. Now he was completing the circle by commenting on the   gorilla who briefly stole the spotlight from him for one holiday weekend. For the record, Mr. Trump said that he thought zoo officials had little choice but to shoot Harambe. But, he added: “There were moments with the gorilla, the way he held that child, it was almost like a mother with a baby. It looked so beautiful and calm. And then there were moments when it looked pretty dangerous. ” So it is with Mr. Trump and the news media, and their volatile symbiosis. Tuesday morning, he was in raging silverback mode, glowering, posturing and verbally dragging the press around his gilded Manhattan lair. But viewed from another vantage point, it can look as if he were holding them very close.', 'The immense popularity enjoyed by Pope Francis ever since his election in 2013 has precipitated sharply during the past year, and he no longer ranks among the top ten most admired men in the world, according to a massive new study involving 31, 000 interviews. [According to a study released this week by YouGov, an international market research firm based in the UK, from 2015 to 2016 the Pope experienced the most dramatic drop in popularity of any public figure, falling from sixth to 13th place.  Even in his native Argentina, the Pope was the fourth most popular man, behind the Dalai Lama, and Argentine soccer players Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez. According to the report, American billionaire Bill Gates and Russian President Vladimir Putin both have better numbers than the pontiff, and the Dalai Lama, David Beckham and scientist Stephen Hawking edged past the Pope as well. YouGov ranks the world’s 20 most admired men and women separately, and found Angelina Jolie to be the most admired woman in the world for the second year in a row, followed by Queen Elizabeth II and Hillary Clinton. Pope Francis does, however, remain the   admired man in the United States after President Barack Obama. Although YouGov does not ask people to give reasons for their preferences, the group hazards the guess that the pope’s drop may be explained by “expectations of reform” that distanced Francis from his predecessors, which have waned as the Argentine pontiff becomes “institutionalized. ” Follow Thomas D.

Priorities USA raised $21. 6 million from wealthy Democrats, according to spokesman Justin Barasky, more than twice what it raised during the prior month. The organization had $41. 5 million on hand as of August 31, money it is pouring into swing states to finance what has so far been a relentless paid media campaign against Trump, though his poll numbers remain competitive. The group, now led by Clinton loyalists, struggled at the beginning of the campaign to install donor confidence, but has over the course of the race raised more than $130 million from Democratic donors. The group claims another $29 million in commitments. The names of their latest donors will not be disclosed until later this month, but several perennial Democratic heavyweights    from Haim Saban to Donald Sussman    have cut the group checks in recent months. Trump’s several super PACs, on the other hand, have largely sputtered, with none managing to convince donors that they are the premier place to park their cash. The most successful group, Rebuilding America Now, has raised more than $13 million but has had trouble in recent months convincing major GOP donors to invest in Trump.  That discrepancy has led to an unprecedented advertising advantage for Clinton forces, who spent much of the summer blasting Trump on the airwaves with little reciprocation from the Republican nominee. ”Hillary Clinton and her super PACs have spent over $130 million on negative political ads,” Trump’s finance chair, Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement earlier Thursday. ”And yet we are virtually tied (or better) in the most recent national polls and leading in many of the important swing states.” ', 'What if the surgeon started slicing into my knee before it was completely numb? That was my biggest fear, while weighing whether to remain alert and watch the operation on the cartilage in my right knee, or to be put to sleep, preserving my peaceful ignorance. Rational or otherwise, my reasons for staying awake  —   an option increasingly taken by patients, the subject of the accompanying article  —   prevailed. 1) I don’t like general anesthesia’s side effects. 2) For a long year, my knee pain had resisted straightforward diagnosis and treatment. I wanted an  ! glimpse of the problem. 3) Ever since I was a child, I have watched when the doctor gives me an injection. Not because I am brave, masochistic or even curious. On the contrary. Looking away, I imagine something far scarier. So watching a medical procedure has always been a form of  . (Related: As more patients stay awake for surgery, doctors have to watch what they say.) There I lay on the operating room table at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, jabbering nervously to the anesthesiologist, waiting for the spinal block, an injection that was supposed to render the lower part of my body numb, to kick in. I didn’t know the etiquette. Was I permitted to talk? Or would that distract everyone? How would they know when the block was working? Was I already talking too much? Was that beleaguered exasperation in the anesthesiologist’s eyes? I thought they had given me a sedative. Is this me on sedatives? A blue surgical cloth had been draped over my hips. A nurse hoisted a bare limb and began washing it with sterilizer. How odd, I thought: Why have they brought a mannequin leg into the O. R.? Maybe a Halloween joke? I peered closely and recognized the chipped summer toenail polish. Wait. That leg belonged to me. The regional block was working. My surgeon, Dr. Robert G. Marx, strode in, greeting everyone, just another day at the office. We were ready to begin. He called for music. It so happens that about seven lifetimes ago, I was a disc jockey. The experience left me a little judgmental, perhaps, about others’ musical tastes. What would I put on the playlist “Music for Watching One’s Own Surgery”? (Rod Stewart, “The First Cut Is the Deepest” Louis Armstrong, “Mack the Knife”?) It would certainly not include Dr. Marx’s   choice: Rush, the Canadian   band. But Dr. Marx was raised in Canada. (So many other   musicians to choose from: Neil Young! Oscar Peterson! Drake! No, not Justin Bieber. Please.) Now he was bopping around, looking pumped. And there was my favorite right knee, naked, powerless in his hands. So I said nothing. To a civilian like me, arthroscopic surgery is astonishing. Although I couldn’t see what Dr. Marx was doing, he narrated as he made two incisions: one for a tiny camera, the other for a tiny instrument. Then, on an overhead monitor, video appeared. Now we could all have a good look around my knee innards. Very cool. Cartilage is relatively bloodless, shiny and white. “There’s your honker!” Dr. Marx explained, using his highfalutin medical term for the floating fragment of my medial meniscus. Whenever I attacked stairs, that piece tugged on the highly sensitive knee capsule, dense with nerves. I felt relief and affirmation. This pain had not been in my head. The fragments looked like rubbery slivers of squid sashimi, fluttering in dark video tunnels. Dr. Marx quietly pointed out that because I’d had this surgery once before (under general anesthesia) after today I would not have much medial meniscus remaining. Anxiously hanging on his every word, I did not find the news reassuring. The wistful, shimmering mirage of my 5K morning runs dimmed. But I felt better prepared for whatever the surgical outcome might be. For I could see exactly what he was talking about. Then he went after the honker and its progeny, elegantly chewing them up with an arthroscopic biter and smoothing down the edges with a shaver so that the remnants resembled a normal meniscus. Afterward, as I waited for the regional block to wear off, I was alert, with none of the chills or grogginess that bedeviled me with general anesthesia. I left the hospital a   patient, with new respect for the operating room staff members. And a speech to deliver to Dr. Marx about his musical taste.', 'McALLEN, Texas  —   For the twelfth year in a row, McAllen Police and their civilian Crime Stoppers program have reached out to the needy families by helping them enjoy a Thanksgiving meal. [More than 150 families lined up outside of the McAllen Police station for the 12th Annual Turkey Giveaway. The families were chosen by the local school district and police officers who identified need in the communities they patrol. During the giveaway, residents were given shopping bags with a turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and other Thanksgiving staples.  “For these families, this will be their Thanksgiving meal,” McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez told Breitbart Texas. “If it wasn’t for this effort by our Crime Stopper volunteers, these families would not be able to enjoy a proper Thanksgiving meal. ”  The Crime Stoppers program gives police officers and investigators another way to get help from the community in solving crimes where law enforcement may hit a roadblock. According to Rodriguez, throughout the year, McAllen Police asks for the community’s help in obtaining information and the giveaway is just one way for the Crime Stoppers program and his department to pay it back.  “This department has a close relation with the community,” Rodriguez said. “Our residents trust us and event like this or our Christmas event allow us to be closer to them. ”    McAllen resident San Juana Avila held back tears as the volunteers handed her food.  “They are so nice,” Avila said. “In the news people say bad things about police officers but no, they are a blessing. They are there to help and they have been very nice to me   …     I pray they receive many blessings. ”  Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

So when Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Saturday  —   a day after his crushing defeat in the House on health care  —   that people should watch her show that night, political observers began guessing what was in store. What she delivered was a diatribe against the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. “Paul Ryan needs to step down as speaker of the House,” Ms. Pirro, a former prosecutor, said at the opening of her show. “The reason? He failed to deliver the votes on his health care bill. ” In Ms. Pirro’s telling, Mr. Ryan let Mr. Trump down by not doing his share of the work in corralling Republican votes to fulfill a   promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  —   a view held by a number of the president’s advisers. “Speaker Ryan, you come in with all your swagger and experience and you sell ’em a bill of goods, which ends up a complete and total failure, and you allow our president in his first 100 days to come out of the box like that, based on what?” Ms. Pirro said. On Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, an ally of Mr. Ryan’s, said he had not spoken to the president about the Twitter post, but he called the timing “coincidental. ” Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, said, “The speaker and president talked for an hour yesterday about moving forward on the agenda, and their relationship is stronger than ever right now. ” Another spokesman in Mr. Ryan’s office said on Sunday: “The two spoke again today, and the president was clear his tweet had nothing to do with the speaker. They are both eager to get back to work on the agenda. ” On Friday, after House Republicans pulled the health care bill, Mr. Trump voiced support for Mr. Ryan, saying the speaker had worked “very, very hard. ” A person close to the president said that aides did not believe that Mr. Trump had spoken with Ms. Pirro before his Twitter post, or that he was trying to advertise criticism of Mr. Ryan’s leadership. But Mr. Trump has a long history with Ms. Pirro. During the worst weekend of the Trump campaign, when Mr. Trump was under siege over an    outtake from “Access Hollywood,” he told aides that he would do an interview with Ms. Pirro to defend himself, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation. He was dissuaded by aides who told him it would not be viewed as credible by voters. In their phone call on Saturday, according to a person briefed on the matter, Mr. Ryan told Mr. Trump that he wanted to proceed with a tax overhaul package. Their relationship, so far, has seemed to hold. But privately, Mr. Trump has been pressed by some advisers to consider the damage wrought by the bill’s failure, and to consider Mr. Ryan’s role. Publicly, at least, Mr. Trump was casting blame on Sunday morning not on Mr. Ryan but on the   conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus, as well as outside conservative groups.', '’  ’ ’   Former secretary of state Colin Powell is no fan of Donald Trump. ’ ’   In a slew of emails obtained by  Powell tore into the Republican presidential   candidate referring to him as an “international pariah” and a   “national disgrace. ” ’ ’   In one email, Powell denounced Trump for perpetuating the   “racist” birther movement that questioned President Barack   Obama’s US citizenship. ’ ”   “Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,” Powell wrote,   according to the BuzzFeed News report. “That’s what the 99%   believe. When Trump couldn’t keep that up he said he also wanted   to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim. ” ” ’   In another exchange, Powell went off on media  —   echoing the   position of other lawmakers who believe the press helped fuel   Trump’s rise. ’ ’’ ’   “You guys are playing his game, you are his oxygen,” he said.   ”[Trump] outraged us again today with his comments on Paris     for police districts.

[“Well, I got there a little before he did and had a chance to talk with the people there, and it was really, really interesting. ” Knight recalled. “I could sense a great anticipation. This place was  . I would imagine there were three, four thousand people there. I just scanned the audience, and I could see that on the face of everybody, anticipation of what St. Donald had to talk about. ”  LISTEN: “I think that it went extremely well in his favor. And the reason I think so is that I think people look at Trump as just another really concerned American citizen  —   like you are, and I am, and thousands of people are,” he told Boyle. “He had a great rapport with those people last night. ” Boyle asked Knight to turn his coach’s eye upon Trump and talk about the qualities that make him a “winner,” as he “fights these epic political battles. ” “You brought up something that not many people would, and it really impresses me,” Knight said, phrasing his reply in basketball coach terms: We have an opponent, when I was coaching, whoever that opponent might be, it’s my responsibility to give the players the tools to beat that opponent. They have a good pressing defense. I’ve got to figure out a way to beat that press. Or they have a tough zone defense, or they have a post man who’s very difficult to play against. It’s my responsibility to see that my players have the tools to win that game  —   not they figure it out  —   I figure it out, and then they do the job. Now, that’s what brings me to Donald Trump. I was a history and government major at Ohio State University, and I’ve spent a lot of time just fiddling around with who the next President’s going to be, over the years, or who would I like to see in that job, or whatever. And I’ve come to believe, without any reservation, in this era the   person for this job by far is Donald Trump. The reason is because he has learned how to deal with problems. You know, he’s not just an American. He’s international. Everyone knows him. He has business all over the world. He’s provided jobs everywhere. And all of the things he’s done, like all of us, we run into problems. But I’ve studied his background, and I’ve looked at what he’s been into. And something went wrong here, but he took care of it, and he straightened it out, and he did something else over there. I think the key thing to this next president is: number one, a guy who has a tremendous love of the good old USA. And secondly, that president brings with him or her the background and the tools to do the job that it’s going to take to get these problems straightened out. Nobody that I’ve talked to has even attempted to challenge the fact that no one matches Donald Trump in that regard. Boyle described the “Trumpocrats”  —   Democrats who are abandoning Hillary Clinton to vote for Donald Trump because they don’t trust her  —   and asked Knight if he saw signs of such a movement in Indiana. “Well, I hope so because I think that’s important to the future of our country,” said Knight. “I think the way he’s going to approach things, his relationship with the military will be absolutely beyond that of anything we’ve seen in a long way. There will be no president ever having a greater feeling for the military and all aspects of our military. ” “And you can bet the farm on two things: that there will never be a Benghazi situation under a Donald Trump administration, nor will there ever be money that is given to somebody in the Trump administration by foreign countries that they use for their own benefit. That kind of thing just won’t ever happen,” he declared. “But even more important, I think, is the relationship he will have with our military,” Knight stressed. “What is more important to us than the Marines, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, our whole military establishment, and what those men, and those women, do for the United States is something beyond all of us as citizens, really can’t come to thank them enough for what they do. And there’ll be nobody in our governmental history that will be more inclined to deal and work with our military establishment than Donald Trump. ” Boyle asked if Hillary Clinton’s frequent disappearances from the campaign trail marked her as a “  candidate,” and asked Knight what sort of energy level voters should seek in a president. “I’m going to throw something at you, and then you tell me what you think of what I’ve said, OK?” Knight proposed: Here’s what I’m going to throw at you: Donald Trump has been out every day  —   morning, noon and night  —   to let people see who he is. He isn’t hiding anywhere. He isn’t sitting back home anyplace. He’s out there letting people ask him questions. And when he gets done, he stands there, and a little old grandma comes up and asks her a question, he gives her an answer. And he’s out there 24 hours a day, almost, letting people see who he is and giving people a chance to give this guy a look. How do we like this guy? We got to get him to quiet a little bit more, he walks flat, whatever the heck he does. You know, he has allowed America to see just exactly who he is and what he is, and he’s not coming out of the closet. He’s out there showing and talking about just what and who he is. I think that’s a tremendous thing that he’s doing. He is saying, ‘Folks, here’s what I think, and here I am. I want you to just see what you think.’ Knight said it was astute for Boyle to observe that Hillary Clinton is spending much of the campaign “hiding from us. ” “It seems to me that we’ve got one candidate here that’s giving everybody a chance to take a look at him, and we’ve got another one where no one’s sure where the hell that candidate is,” Knight said. “I think that says a lot. ” He said being around Trump was always “interesting. ” “I’m a teacher. My mother was a teacher. I spent 40 years as a teacher. I think I have a pretty good grasp of people, and here is a guy who is thoroughly, totally in love with the United States of America, I think as much as anybody I’ve ever known,” he said of Donald Trump. “His goal in life is to do something for America. And again, I say to anybody, you show me who can bring better tools to the job than Donald Trump can, and I’ll vote for that guy along with you,” Knight challenged.

[There was no formal decision by the UN to host Muslim prayers.  The space has simply been booked without further explanation.  Muslim prayers at the UN have been operating for some time, though UN staffers are   about when they began and who started them. There is an ecumenical “meditation room”  —   without religious markings  —   that is continually open to the public and adherents of any faith. A plaque outside explains that the room was “personally planned and supervised in every detail” by former UN   Dag Hammarskjold in 1957. Hammarskjold’s aim was to create “a place where the doors may be open to the infinite lands of thought and prayer. People of many faiths will meet here  …    [I]t is dedicated to the God whom man worships under many names and in many forms. ” Prior to recent renovations, Muslim prayers had used a remote venue on a floor above the library. Today, one finds dozens of prayer rugs permanently set aside for use every Friday in the General Assembly building. The space is booked  —   the UN won’t say by whom  —   from 11:45 a. m. to 3:00 p. m. and unavailable for anything else. Muslim prayers are now so popular that they spill into the path of public tours, with upwards of hundreds of shoes lining the halls. By contrast, Christians, Jews, Hindus, and members of other faiths do not hold their regular services at the UN. Evidently, just one religion finds the ecumenical room insufficient for its purposes. This despite a UN Charter that promises to reaffirm “equal rights,” and to promote “respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to religion. ”  Not to mention the host country’s commitment to the separation of church and state. American taxpayers recently contributed half a billion dollars to renovate the UN. Little do Americans know that their money funded space for Friday Muslim prayer services. The “Capital Master Plan” renovations, which ran for seven years until   cost Americans $488 million, according to the U. S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). With our open wallet, the UN merrily went $379 million over budget, according to the UN  —   and at least $430 million over budget, according to the GAO. American dollars didn’t just help renovate the space appropriated for weekly Muslim prayers. They also helped carve out an “East Lounge” that UN   Ban   called “perfect for    negotiations. ” The decorations were donated by Qatar in 2013. Qatar paid only about $4 million as its mandatory assessed contribution to the Capital Master Plan, and then added a bit for the following East Lounge touches: black and gold embroidered couches, chairs, pillows, and engraved tables, with six   ornaments reminiscent of minarets. Or, as UN   Ban   put it: “I am especially grateful that this lounge reflects Qatari culture. ” (Among other things, Qatar is known to bankroll terrorist organizations like Hamas.) The UN donations website claims that there was a renovation “policy” developed to govern spaces in the building that were “available for adoption”  —   but the policy is mysteriously unavailable. Perhaps it is the same policy that has resulted in the obscene repositioning of the UN’s revisionist “Palestine” exhibit next door to the Holocaust exhibit. UN indoctrination isn’t subtle, and it isn’t cheap. With the Organization of Islamic Cooperation having colonized the place, perhaps it is about time somebody asked those wanting to be the next American president why we are paying for it.

The California lawmaker was responding to the latest hacking incident, into the House Democratic campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which on Friday night published members’ personal cell phone numbers and some private email addresses. The hacker going by ”Guccifer 2. 0” claimed credit. ”I was in the air flying from Florida to California when the news broke,” Pelosi said in a message to Democratic colleagues. ”Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages. Please be careful not to allow your children or family members to answer your phone or read incoming text messages.” Democrats see chance to reshape map as Trump stumbles, Pelosi also advised House Democrats affected to change their phone numbers, following her lead.  The information was published to a WordPress blog along with   materials for subscriptions the DCCC uses.  Top Clinton State Department aide helped Clinton Foundation, A phone call was held Saturday evening for members with the House    office, and cybersecurity experts who have been investigating the hack. This is the latest   hack since the release of Democratic National Committee emails that led to the resignation of Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, an episode Pelosi called an ”electronic Watergate.”  One leading Democratic member of Congress told CNN he got some ”nasty phone calls” as well as texts and emails following the disclosure of personal information. The member, who requested anonymity because he didn’t want to encourage more negative taunts coming his way, described some of the messages he received as ”expletive Democrat” or ”expletive Hillary” or ”expletive Congress.” Some members of Congress as well as some staff members Saturday quickly changed their phone numbers after the information was made public late Friday. ”It is scary that your privacy can be lost” so quickly, the member said. Besides members having to endure a barrage of hate messages, they are also being warned to be careful. ”There certainly can be a security threat,” the member said. One major concern are the emails sent to the members or the staff could include website links with malware or phishing attempts to steal identities or financial information. Congressional security officials have warned members and staff not to click on websites they are not familiar with. There was a phone briefing for members on Saturday evening to answer their questions and give advice, and the hack will also be discussed Tuesday in a regularly scheduled conference call. ”A lot of members are trying to get the word on what is best to do,” said the congressman. While the hacker or hackers known as ”Guccifer 2. 0” claims to have released the information about the Democratic congressional members and staffers through a blog, that is not the only mechanism being used to publicize private information. A Washington area cyber security firm, ThreatConnect, has released a new analysis tying documents from various hacks by ”Guccifer 2. 0” to a website called DCLeaks, which calls itself ”a new level project aimed to analyze and publish a large amount of emails from   officials and their influence agents all over the world” and has been publishing documents since this past spring. While the US government has not formally blamed Russia for these hacks, privately intelligence and law enforcement sources it is the most likely suspect. Some private cyber security experts also believe ”Guccifer 2. 0” is somehow connected to Russia and its intelligence operation.   ”He is using a   VPN service” for transmitting, Toni Gidwani, director of research operations at ThreatConnect, told CNN. ”It all points back to Russia.” Exactly how all of the pieces fit together is something both the US government and private experts are trying to piece together. ”We assess that DCLeaks is another Russian influence operation, possibly put on by the same Russian actors behind the ”Guccifer 2. 0” persona,” states the ThreatConnect analysis.   Analysts are examining language used when posting and other signs to try to determine if ”Guccifer 2. 0” is a real person, a group of people, or just a front. Guccifer 2. 0 has not publicly mentioned the DCLeaks, but officials from ThreatConnect say there is evidence ”Guccifer 2. 0” had prior knowledge of what was going to be published on DCLeaks. Most of what DCLeaks has made public has focused on individual Democrats such as a Hillary Clinton aide and liberal Democratic donor George Soros. It also published emails from retired General Philip Breedlove, who had served as NATO supreme commander who wanted to be more aggressive against Russia regarding Ukraine. Also posted on the site    something that has not generated a lot of attention   were just under 300 purported emails from Republicans. Those messages were first posted in June and include several from Sen. Lindsey Graham’s Senate account, including mentions on social media and speaking invitations and a store receipt sent to Sen. John McCain’s campaign. ”It suggests the Republicans have been targeted,” said ThreatConnect’s Gidwani. She added however analysts don’t know whether this shows the hacking was really aimed at members of both parties or just an attempt to make it look that way. It is not known how those documents were obtained. Spokesmen for DCLeaks, Graham and McCain did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Tuesday turned out to be quite the day for the English language. [First, Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Mike Schmidt said that Philadelphia’s Odubel Herrera’s “language barrier” prevented him from becoming a player that the Phillies could build around. Then, Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy got in on the act.  During the middle innings of Tuesday night’s game between the Yankees and the Red Sox, Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka had a meeting on the mound with Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild, and Tanaka’s translator. Tanaka, who hails from Japan, needs the translator because he doesn’t speak English. Shortly after Tanaka’s translator walked off the mound, Remy   on the subject of foreign players using translators. Remy said, “I don’t think that should be legal. I really don’t. ” “What is it you don’t like about that?” asked Red Sox    announcer Dave O’Brien. “Learn baseball language,” Remy said. “It’s pretty simple. You break it down pretty easy between pitching coach and pitcher after a long period of time. ” It’s unknown if Remy made these comments because of Schmidt’s earlier remarks. It’s impossible to imagine that Remy wasn’t aware of them. Either way, this seems like a perfectly stupid thing to say. Who cares whether or not the guy uses a translator? “Learn baseball language?” If signs, and a couple carefully selected words were all that was needed to communicate with a pitcher, then managers and pitching coaches would never go to the mound, and would just give signals from the dugout. By definition, if the team ventures out to the mound, unless they’re just stalling for time, it means something needed to be said which required actual conversation. If the player and the coach don’t speak the same language, that’s a problem. Masahiro Tanaka isn’t some refugee, or illegal alien attempting to make America become more like Japan. He’s a baseball player, being paid $155 million dollars to win baseball games. Something he hasn’t done a whole lot of this year. That’s a bigger problem. One obvious enough that it doesn’t require a translator.

[The Thelma  Louise star made her prediction during an interview with People magazine that was published Friday.  “I’m excited and encouraged by the idea that maybe if everything’s falling apart so obviously  —   I mean, I don’t think Trump’s gonna make it through his whole term,” Sarandon said. “But he’s not the first one to have Goldman Sachs in his cabinet, he’s not the one that started fracking wholeheartedly,” she said of Trump’s administration, which includes five people with ties to the Wall Street bank. “So where have we been? We’ve been asleep. ” Sarandon, of course, was a committed supporter of Vermont’s Sen. Bernie Sanders’ White House bid. She accused what she called the “completely corrupt” Democratic National Committee of rigging the primary in favor of Hillary Clinton. The Academy   eventually endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein in a letter, writing that the “fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption. ” Now, the    actress, whose cleavage is turning heads on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival, says she’s optimistic since average Americans are becoming more politically aware and involved. “I’m actually optimistic because I think we’re seeing an amazing revolution happening,” the star told People. “Not by the people that claim to be political but by Americans, and I have great faith in America.

But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32, 000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38, 000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. “The   estimates are likely incorrect,” Jesse Richman, one of the   of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don’t answer a question correctly  —   in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is  . An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual. The survey  —   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  —   was huge, with 38, 000 respondents in 2008. And the group in question  —   noncitizens  —   was very small, just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey’s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  —   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents. If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted, then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of noncitizens voted. This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study. Critics of the study  —   Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist, Samantha Luks, a statistician at YouGov, and Brian  Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  —   were able to marshal evidence strongly consistent with that possibility, because of the survey’s unusual design: Thousands of voters are   in subsequent elections. That allowed the study’s critics to check whether people were consistent about their answer on the citizenship answer from year to year. If the people were consistent, they were probably noncitizens. If voters were inconsistent, it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship. There was not much consistency. Between 2010 and 2012, 20 voters switched from being citizens to noncitizens (an extremely unlikely transition) and 36 others switched from noncitizens to citizens (a more common transition, but one reported at a far greater rate than typically occurs). These shifting answers strongly bolster the theory that many of the respondents logged as noncitizens had responded in error. But most important, among the 85 respondents who said they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012  —   those most likely to really be noncitizens  —   none had voted in the 2010 midterm elections. The critics concluded that “the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U. S. elections is 0. ” In a response published in October, Mr. Richman and his colleagues did not contest the finding that measurement error probably exaggerated the number of noncitizen voters. “The response error issues they focus on may have biased our numbers,” Mr. Richman said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Richman and his colleagues have not estimated a new range of possible noncitizen voting. Instead, the October response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting. They argued that measurement error couldn’t explain all of the people who said they were noncitizens and voted. When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file. The matching process is good but imperfect, and becomes harder with less information  —   like the absence of a specific address or date of birth. That the respondent said he or she wasn’t registered certainly raises the possibility that the match was wrong. “I haven’t seen any evidence that I would say shows that any noncitizens vote,” Mr. Schaffner said. “That doesn’t mean that the rate is exactly zero. But it does mean that it’s   frequency that we can’t even measure it with traditional methods. ”', ' (CNN) James Bond’s latest mission has been revealed in the first trailer for ”SPECTRE” which was released Friday.

A prior draft of the order, however  —   leaked to the   Nation in February  —   reportedly would “create wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious objections to   marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity. ”  The leak of the original draft to the Nation, says Politico, was “the handiwork, many conservatives believed, of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have sought to project themselves as friendly to the LGBT community. ” Leftwing groups condemned the draft executive order as overtly discriminatory. The Nation continued: The   draft order, a copy of which is currently circulating among federal staff and advocacy organizations, construes religious organizations so broadly that it covers “any organization, including closely held   corporations,” and protects “religious freedom” in every walk of life: “when providing social services, education, or healthcare earning a living, seeking a job, or employing others receiving government grants or contracts or otherwise participating in the marketplace, the public square, or interfacing with Federal, State or local governments. In a statement released Wednesday, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said the report of the order is “very welcome news. ” “Speaking as one who has spent the last five years in federal courts  —   and who is still in court  —   defending the right of religious groups and individuals to practice our beliefs, President Trump’s anticipated executive order is cause for celebration,” Pavone said. “For far too long, government has been trying to confine faith to the four walls of houses of worship. I’m confident that President Trump’s order will reinforce the Constitution’s guarantee that our religious beliefs are to be protected, not attacked. ” Reports of the new executive order come amid complaints that the Trump Department of Justice is still continuing its contraceptive mandate cases against religious   such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. Catholic News Agency reports the plaintiffs in these cases expected the federal government would drop its appeals once Trump took office. However, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty  —   which represents many of the plaintiffs in the HHS contraceptive mandate cases  —   observed that the Obama administration’s lawyers who litigated these cases are still on board in the Trump Department of Justice. During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised faith leaders and employers relief from the Obamacare mandate that requires most employers to provide contraception,   drugs, and sterilization procedures to their workers in health insurance plans. In a letter to the Catholic Leadership Conference last October, Trump told Catholic leaders prior to the November election that Hillary Clinton’s support for the HHS mandate “is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump Administration. ” Trump wrote: On life, I am, and will remain,  . I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs. “We are grateful to have a president who is committed to defending a value so basic to Americans as religious freedom,” Pavone said. “We look forward not only to his executive actions, but also to legislation that will further protect religious liberty from unjust government mandates and from the oppressive restrictions of such measures as the Johnson Amendment. ”', 'WASHINGTON  —   Major changes to nutrition labels on food packages became final on Friday, with calorie counts now shown in large type and portion sizes that reflect how much Americans actually eat. It was the first significant redrawing of the nutrition information on food labels since the federal government started requiring them in the early 1990s. Those labels were based on eating habits and nutrition data from the 1970s and ’80s and before portion sizes expanded significantly. Federal health officials argued that the changes were needed to bring labels into step with the reality of the modern American diet. The Food and Drug Administration  proposed the changes in 2014, but consumer advocates worried that many of the major elements would not survive lobbying by the powerful food industry. A number of companies vigorously opposed, for example, a separate line for added sugars. But the final rule, announced by Michelle Obama on Friday, mostly remained intact, including the line on added sugars. “This has to be scored as a huge win,” said Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “The F. D. A. ’s final rules confirm what the agency proposed originally on the most important elements. The big ones  —   calories, added sugars  —   survived. ” The changes jump out. The calories are in large bold numbers, and are easier to spot at a glance. A single ice cream serving is   of a cup  —   compared with the current half cup. Most food manufacturers will be required to use the new label by July 2018. Producers with less than $10 million in annual food sales will have an additional year to comply. Millions of Americans pay attention to food labels. The changes are meant to make them easier to understand  —   a critical step in an era when more than   of adults are obese, public health experts say. The epidemic has caused rates of diabetes to soar and has increased risks for cancer, heart disease and stroke. Comments from companies and trade associations seemed to reflect acceptance. The American Beverage Association said its members had already put clearer calorie counts on the front of beverage bottles as a part of Ms. Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents food and beverage companies, said, “We look forward to working with F. D. A. and other stakeholders on messages and activities to help consumers understand what the new labels mean. ” But the sugar industry did not relent in its criticism. The Sugar Association said it was “disappointed” by the F. D. A. ’s decision to require a separate line for added sugars. It argued that the rule lacked “scientific justification. ” The association said, “We are concerned that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent that is not grounded in science, and could actually deter us from our shared goal of a healthier America. ” Getting the original nutrition labels on food packages was a major battle. Dr. David Kessler, the former F. D. A. commissioner, said the fight went all the way to the Oval Office, where the first President George Bush sided with the agency in what was considered a major victory for public health. “They got this right,” he said of the new changes in an interview on Friday. “This will affect people’s lives. It gives really important information to people who want to use it. ” It is also important for the food and beverage industry, he said. “By putting added sugars on the label, it creates incentives for industry to make healthier products, because they don’t want to look bad with all of that sugar on the label. ” Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said he believed the new line for added sugars would help change behavior. “A lot of people will be shocked to see how much sugar is in soda,” he said. “Teachers and parents will leap at that as something to show their kids. ” A   can of Coke has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar, which, according to Mr. Jacobson, is about the equivalent of 9. 2 teaspoons. He said a shortcoming of the new rules was that companies could still express sugar in grams, not in teaspoons.', 'Immigration activists in Los Angeles are enraged after the mother of a prominent open borders activist is expected to be deported. [Following a massive drug raid by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency at an apartment complex, Teresa   an illegal immigrant, was detained and now is facing deportation, according to the L. A. Times.    has been living in the U. S. since 2001 and her husband, Hugo Rueda, was arrested for drug possession by officials in the raid, where Rueda’s car allegedly had 33 pounds of cocaine in it, and the couple’s apartment had $600, 000 cash inside, along with an ounce of crystal methamphetamine. Federal officials believe Rueda is involved with the   U. S.  drug trade.   is the mother of Los Angeles immigration activist Claudia Rueda, who claims her mother was detained by authorities illegally, despite her mother’s illegal immigrant status. A small   rally was held at the Border Patrol station in San Ysidro near San Diego, with “Free Teresa now” chants from protesters. An organizer of the protest told the L. A. Times that not only should   not have been detained, but she also claimed federal authorities arrested the woman because her daughter is an activist against immigration enforcement. “We think it is retaliation against her mother for her daughter’s activism,” Marcela Hernandez said. In a statement to the L. A. Times, Claudia Rueda said authorities should let her mother out of federal custody. “Despite being told she would not be detained as long she cooperated, my mother was apprehended during an illegally conducted raid at my apartment,” Rueda said. “I know my mother is innocent, and both [the Sheriff’s Department and Border Patrol] know that, which is why they were supposed to let her go,” Rueda continued.   is awaiting a deportation hearing before an immigration judge and is expected to be deported.

There was greed.   There was   crime. ’ ”   It was also the most realistic Wall Street movie I’ve ever   seen. The story follows a senior banker staging a comeback   after a botched IPO by fighting to take the next big Silicon   Valley startup public. ” ’   ”Equity” provides a real look into the lives of investment   bankers, and why their careers involve so much work and   travel  —   but, perhaps more notably, it’’s a refreshing change of   pace after eight years of Wall Street movies about the financial   crisis. ’ ”   It’s so entertaining you almost forget another remarkable   detail about the film: The movie was written, directed, produced,   and starred in by women.   ” ’’ ’   ”Equity” passes the  with flying colors  —   that is, the rule created in   1985 by the cartoonist Alison Bechdel that requires movies to   have at least two women who speak to each other and specifically   not speak about a man. ’ ’   But ”Equity” is not an overtly feminist statement. It’’s not a   story about women fighting to break the glass ceiling or getting   overlooked because of their sex. Really,   it just feels like a great Wall Street movie in which   the main characters happen to be women. ’ ”   For one thing, the female characters are multidimensional.   You feel for the vice president who hides her pregnancy so as not   to inhibit a potential promotion, and you feel betrayed when you   realize she’s also capable of doing bad. The   senior   banker who sometimes treats her subordinates badly is more than   just a bossy woman; she is conflicted, and she’s actually   trying to do the right thing. ” ”   In other words, it wouldn’t be a stretch to imagine men   in each of these roles, rather than women. And that’s kind of   refreshing too. ” ”   I often write about women on Wall Street, and I generally hear a   similar story: Women tend to work harder than men, but have to   fight twice as hard to get ahead. We think we’ll get ahead with   hard work, when really we should be focusing more on   networking, like men do. ” ’   So I was expecting more of the same message when I watched   ”Equity.” That I didn’’t get that message was a pleasant surprise.   Instead, I got to watch a fun movie about some dynamic Wall   Streeters taking a tech unicorn public. ’ ’   To be sure, there are challenges the bankers face that are   undoubtedly due to their gender, and there is still a feminist   message being given. ’ ”   The main character, Naomi Bishop, for example, is told she rubs   people the wrong way  —   a description that’s undoubtedly used more   often for women than for men. But ultimately, the reason she has   to fight so hard for the promotion is because of a   previous business transaction gone wrong  —   a hurdle   that could just as easily apply to a man. ” ’   I’’m telling everyone I know to go see ”Equity” this   weekend  —   not just because important to see strong   women in positions of power, regardless of how seamlessly that   goal is accomplished. You can go see ”Equity” for   that reason, or you can go because it’’s a really good   movie. ’ ’I just watched ”Equity,” the highly anticipated. ..’', ' (CNN) Ahmed Mohammed Ali has been working to bring his    daughter Eman to the United States since she was a toddler. She finally got her visa last month and the two of them were waiting for the flight that would bring them from Djibouti to the United States on Saturday, when they found out about President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on immigrants from seven countries. ”We were in line with the luggage and they told us she can’t get on the plane because she has a Yemeni passport,” Ali said. ”She is a    girl. How is she a terrorist?” Ali and his daughter are just one of the families whose lives have been disrupted by the immigration ban since it was enacted January 27. Here are four of their stories. Eman Ali, 12, Yemen, Eman Ali was born in Yemen in 2005, when her pregnant mother went there to help with a family emergency. Eman is the only member of her family who’s not an American citizen. When they were ready to return home to California in 2007, they couldn’t because of Eman’s immigration status. The family found out Eman wasn’t a citizen because her mother hadn’t lived in the United States for five years before she was born. The paperwork for Eman’s visa took years, so her mother and sister stayed with her in Yemen while her father worked at a shopping center to support them. In 2013 they made an agonizing choice. ”I (had) to let my wife and oldest daughter (come) to (the) US and leave my little one with my dad and mom. I had no choice,” Ali said. ”I couldn’t leave my whole family in Yemen.” They thought Eman would join them soon, but it was almost four years before Ali got to make the trip to Djibouti to finalize her visa at the US Embassy there. The United States does not have an embassy in Yemen because of the civil war that has devastated the country. ”We thought that’s it, it’s the end. The family will be together. Eman was really happy after all those years,” Ali said. ”And then they come with a new law.” It’s too dangerous to send Eman back to Yemen, so they are staying in a Djibouti hotel. It’s expensive, and he can’t work.  The Alis have joined a class action lawsuit against the immigration policy and have gotten support from US Rep. Jim Costa of California. Maryam Hani, 6, Iraq, Maryam Hani was diagnosed with leukemia in October by doctors in an Egyptian refugee camp. Her family fled Iraq’s Anbar province in December 2014 to escape ISIS. ”After ISIS came to Anbar, they attacked the area and arrested people and killed people,” Maryam’s mother, Lequaa Jasim, told CNN through a translator. ”We decided to find a safe place for the family.” Maryam’s father sold his carpentry business and used the money for pay for their dangerous journey to Egypt. Since they are refugees, they have to pay for Maryam’s treatment out of their own pockets.  Refugees also aren’t allowed to work, so they are getting by with help from Maryam’s grandparents, who are permanent US residents and have lived in Boise, Idaho, since 2014. Holda Sadeq, Maryam’s grandmother, says she would like to go to Egypt to help file for a medical visa that would let Maryam come to the United States. However, she has an Iraqi passport, so she fears she would not be able to return to the country.  ”Holda is just learning English. She’s concerned that if she gets on a plane and gets detained somewhere, how is she going to communicate,” said Drew Lobner, a social worker who’s been working with the family since they came to America. For now, they’re waiting and continuing with Maryam’s medical treatment. ”She’s tired and is still in the hospital and she had chemotherapy last week, and today they will give her some vitamins,” Sadeq told CNN on Friday. Maryam has another big chemotherapy treatment coming up and doctors say they will do everything they can to make sure she’s well enough to travel if she gets permission to leave, the family said. Dilbireen Muhsin, 2, Iraq, Severe burns disfigured little Dilbireen Muhsin’s face.  The toddler’s family was forced to flee their home to escape the bloodshed brought on by ISIS when they attacked their village in 2014. They’re Yazidis, part of a small community living around Mount Sinjar in Iraq. Dilbireen’s family found shelter among other displaced Yazidis in a refugee camp, where Dilbireen was born on January 4, 2015. A year later, around Dilbireen’s first birthday, a fire sparked by a malfunctioning gas heater set his crib ablaze. His mother was baking bread outside when her baby’s crib went up in flames, and people nearby rushed to his aid. Dilbireen was severely burned on his face and feet, but a blanket protected the rest of his body from harm. Dilbireen arrived in the United States last year to receive medical treatment for his severe burns.  While he now lives with a family in Lansing, Michigan, his parents and baby brother are in their native country, Iraq. They’re making efforts to be by Dilbireen’s side in the United States, but their travel visas were revoked in early January.  President Donald Trump’s travel ban now has them concerned that they won’t be able to get back to Dilbireen and that he might return to Iraq without additional surgeries to improve the function of his face. Fatemeh Reshad, 4 months, Iran, The travel ban has delayed an Iranian family’s plan to bring their daughter to the United States for potentially lifesaving surgery.    Fatemeh Reshad was diagnosed in January with structural abnormalities and two holes in her heart. Doctors in Tehran told her parents that they did not have the resources to treat the little girl. Fatemeh and her family received an   to enter the US for critical surgery, N. Y.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday.  The family was going to fly to Portland, Oregon, where they have relatives, so Fatemeh could get the treatment she needs. They flew to Dubai, but when they arrived, they were rerouted back to Iran and told to reapply for a US visa in 90 days. Many state and federal officials have intervened on behalf of the family, a Washington, D. C.  immigration attorney working on the case, Amber Murray told CNN.  Attorneys involved with the case worked with State Department officials to help the family obtain an emergency waiver to navigate around the ban.  Mushkaad Abdi, 4, Somalia, Samira Dahir hadn’t seen her    daughter, Mushkaad, since she was a few months old. Dahir had just gotten a visa for herself and her two other daughers when Mushkaad was born. She would have had to start the immigration process over if she remained in Somalia, so she decided instead to leave Mushkaad with a family friend and bring her two other daughters to the United States. Mushkaad had just gotten her visa and was scheduled to fly to Minnesota on Tuesday, but she wasn’t allowed on the flight because of the travel ban. US Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and new Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, made direct pleas to have Mushkaad resettled as a refugee. She was reunited with her mother and two older sisters Thursday. ”It’s been   for Samira and her two older daughters, who have waited to be reunited with Mushkaad since she was an infant,” Franken said in a statement. ”I’m very pleased that after far too long of a separation this Minnesota family is now together.” At a news conference Friday in Minneapolis, Dahir thanked everyone who helped her reunite with her daughter. ”I’m very happy today that my daughter Mushkaad is home,” a tearful Dahir said. ”A lot of people had to work to get my daughter.” Earlier this week, Dahir told CNN affiliate WCCO that she and her older daughters, ages 7 and 8, had decorated a room for their sister and had presents waiting for her. Now Mushkaad will be able to enjoy it.', '’’ ”Marco Rubio’s Twitter account is trending up.” ’In the wake of his futile effort in the Republican presidential primary, the Florida senator has in recent weeks taken to the   outlet with new vigor.’ ’It started May 16, when Rubio sent out a somewhat   post  —   when you consider his use of the medium during the campaign.’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’tAnother genius line claims that Im ”a bit at sea in terms of his next step politically”.

Kennedy Jr. an environmental lawyer and activist, who also happens to be an outspoken vaccine conspiracy theorist. After the meeting, Kennedy told reporters it went “very well,” and said that Trump “asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity. ” He also said that Trump called him to ask for the meeting. But Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team, said in a statement that nothing is certain yet. “The   enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas. The   is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on Autism, which affects so many families however no decisions have been made at this time,” the statement reads. (It is interesting that the team refuted Kennedy’s statement that he would lead a vaccine commission by saying Trump is considering forming a commission on autism, when vaccines are not related to autism.) But the prospect of a   vaccine commission is deeply troubling for proponents of   medicine. For over a decade now, Kennedy has been publicly saying not only that thimerosal, a preservative used in some vaccines, is dangerous and associated with autism, but that the government has been covering this up. He wrote an article about this claim for Rolling Stone in 2005, and published a book about it in 2014. Scientists have found no evidence that thimerosal in vaccines causes any harm, and furthermore, it hasn’t been used in vaccines for children since 2001, with the exception of the flu vaccine. Kennedy said Trump is “very   as am I,” but that Trump “has some doubts about the current vaccine policies. ” For years, Trump has promoted the false link between vaccines and autism, and whether he himself is an   or not, he certainly has courted   at every turn on his road to the White House. This meeting with Kennedy suggests he will continue to do so. Even before he entered politics, Trump said he believed vaccines cause autism. In an interview with the   in 2007, he said: “When I was growing up, autism wasn’t really a factor  …    And now all of a sudden, it’s an epidemic. Everybody has their theory. My theory, and I study it because I have young children, my theory is the shots. We’ve giving these massive injections at one time, and I really think it does something to the children. ” In 2014, Trump tweeted: “Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes   AUTISM. Many such cases!” During the second Republican debate, he told a similar story: “You take this little beautiful baby, and you pump —  I mean, it looks just like it’s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we’ve had so many instances, people that work for me,” he said. “Just the other day, two years old,     years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic. ”’ There is absolutely no evidence that links vaccines to autism. The only study that ever found a link was later revealed to be fraudulent, and was retracted. But still the myth persists, and has now been perpetuated by the   of the United States. Though he’s done some vaccine   Trump has heretofore stopped short of saying children shouldn’t be vaccinated. In that same Republican debate, he said, “I’m totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time   …     I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time. ” In another 2014 tweet, he said“If I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take   AUTISM. ” By “  massive shots,” he likely means schedules where children receive vaccinations for several diseases in one appointment. Slate has called Trump’s position “ ” as opposed to “ . ” However,   including Andrew Wakefield, the author of the debunked autism study, have long seen him to be on their side. “I feel very positive about this, because Donald Trump is not beholden to the pharmaceutical industry,” Wakefield said in an interview with STAT after the election. Kennedy seems to feel similarly. “I think President Trump can be any kind of president that he wants to be. He’s probably come into office less encumbered by ideology or obligations than anybody who has been in political office. ” Perhaps   and vaccine conspiracists see an ally in Trump’s supposed “outsider” status. And despite all the attention   get, it is important to note that it is still a fringe opinion.   percent of Americans, when asked in a 2015 Pew survey, agreed with the science and said they believed vaccines are safe for healthy children.', 'Zika survivors have shared their stories with the media about their experiences with the disease, including links to the rare   syndrome. [A survivor based in New York City told CBS News his joints “felt like lead weights. ” The “    well known in the performing arts” did not want CBS to identify him.  The man known as João and twelve colleagues contracted Zika last spring while in Brazil. He developed   syndrome shortly after he recovered from Zika. “I was on my way to the airport to leave and had to turn back,” he claimed. He decided to seek treatment at a private hospital since the public hospitals had too many patients. João then spent two more weeks in bed at home. “Everyone knows the Zika symptoms, because so many people get it. With   I was paralyzed, I could not walk. All of my joints felt like lead weights,” he said. Three Brazilian doctors misdiagnosed João. He received the correct diagnosis when he returned to New York City. “At Beth Israel, I was diagnosed with   deriving from the Zika virus and had a relapse, at which point the hospital thought I might need blood work, but that did not have to happen,” he continued. “They had never seen a case of Zika, but they said I was recovering well. ” The government now requires local officials to report   due to the hundreds of cases Zika outbreak areas. “  can be a nightmare for those who have it,” Dr. Wellington Galvão, a hematologist in the city of Maceió in northeast Brazil, told The New York Times. “I estimate that Zika increases by about 20 times the probability that an individual can get  . ” Galvão treated 43 patients with   in 2015. The country averages obly 10 to 15 cases a year. The syndrome struck Patricia Brito, a cashier at a local bakery. One day she could move her legs. Next thing she knew she could not feel “her arms, her face and the rest of her body. ” Doctors placed “her on a ventilator in an intensive care unit for 40 days. ” Brito attends physical therapy “to avoid using a wheelchair. ” There is no cure for the syndrome, but Mayo Clinic describes two treatments: Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which manufactures more plasma to make up for what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system’s attack on the peripheral nerves. Immunoglobulin therapy. Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to   syndrome. El Savador recorded 46 cases of   between December 1 and January 6. The country averages 14 cases a month. In Colombia, Deputy Health Minister Fernando Ruiz reported 41 cases of   “that appear to be linked to Zika infections. ” Venezuelan Health Minister Luisana Melo announced 255 cases of   syndrome. Former Health minister Jose Oletta claimed that number proves Venezuela has more than the estimated 4, 500 Zika cases. “Normally, we’d expect 30 or 40 cases of   a month,” he said. “What this shows is that the minister has the total number of Zika cases wrong. ” Lizzie Morales contracted the Zika virus when she visited family in El Salvador over Christmas.  “You have no strength or energy to sit down,” she described. “You just want to lay down and sleep. ” Her first symptoms included body aches and headaches followed by a rash. Vomiting occurred at the end of the infection. “It was all over,” she continued. “Christmas Eve I was scratching. My chest, bumps on my lips, eyes, and ears. ” She received medication in El Salvador. Rio de Janeiro survivor Jane Miranda told ABC News caught Zika last October. It also caused a rash that covered her face and chest. “I started having a fever sensation, without a fever at this point,” she wrote to the network. “My eyes also got irritated. It was very strange, but since I was alone and my parents were out, I decided to wait to visit a doctor. ” She visited a doctor, who confirmed she had Zika. The virus also gave her fatigue. “For the whole week, I had mild fever and the joint and muscle pain became stronger. I couldn’t move or close my hands very well and my felt legs weak,” she said. “The pain lasted for more than a week, but after the first week I almost didn’t feel any pain. ” The National Institutes of Health confirmed that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America. “You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody’s definition that would be considered a pandemic,” explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.', 'Pulse, the Orlando gay nightclub targeted in a jihadist terror attack, was a “  zone” by state law.

The office of Myanmar’s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, said in a statement Monday evening that the rebel group, known as the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, had attacked a hotel, casinos and police and army posts in the town of Laukkai, in Shan State. The group is composed of fighters from the Kokang, an ethnic Chinese group that has strong linguistic and trading ties to China. “Based on initial information, many innocent civilians, including a   teacher, were killed because of attacks by the M. N. D. A. A. ,” the statement said, using the rebel group’s initials. It added that 20 of the 30 bodies were badly burned and therefore unidentifiable, and that the other victims were civilians and traffic police officers. In a separate statement on Monday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said, “I would like to strongly urge all the armed groups to abandon armed attacks that can bring about nothing but sorrows and sufferings on the innocent local tribes and races, and to join the dialogue for national peace. ” Video clips circulating online and in Myanmar’s news media on Tuesday showed burning buildings in Laukkai and rebel fighters exchanging fire with the military. Ashin Kaysara, a monk who lives on the Chinese side of the border, said in an interview on Tuesday that refugees had crossed into China since the fighting began and were staying with relatives or in religious buildings, including his monastery. Ko Maung Kyaw, a witness in Laukkai, said in an interview that he had seen uniformed Kokang fighters attack the sites in Laukkai on Monday with   grenades and other weapons, destroying a hotel, and that the sounds of fighting had continued until about 7 a. m. on Tuesday. “I’m not staying here any longer,” he said. Myanmar Army tanks were patrolling the town’s streets, he added, and bus tickets to Lashio, another town in Shan State, had risen overnight to about $73 from $6. The attacks came as the government doubles down on an effort to broker peace with many of the armed ethnic groups that have long operated in Myanmar’s hinterlands. The next round of talks in a nationwide peace dialogue that began last summer in Naypyidaw, the capital, is scheduled to take place this month. Myanmar’s previous,   government signed a   agreement with eight armed ethnic groups in 2015, but many questions were left unresolved, such as how the central government and the ethnic regions would share power. Another problem was that the agreement, which primarily included armed groups near Myanmar’s border with Thailand, did not cover groups in a wide stretch of territory along the Chinese border, including the Kokang rebels. The Kokang conflict is especially delicate because it touches on Myanmar’s strained relationship with China, which once staunchly supported the junta that held Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 years. Wariness toward Chinese officials and investors now runs high across Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The Kokang rebels are led by Peng Jiasheng, who until 1989 received support from the Communist Party of Burma, a   of the Chinese Communist Party. The rebels signed a   agreement with the Myanmar Army in 1989, after splitting from the Communist Party of Burma, but the truce ended when government troops overran the Kokang in 2009. U Min Zaw Oo, a political analyst in Yangon who advises a government peace commission, said that he believed the rebel group currently had about 1, 000 to 1, 500 fighters and that it targeted casinos in Laukkai controlled by rivals in the Kokang community who are loyal to the Myanmar government. On Tuesday in Beijing, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, said that, to his knowledge, none of those killed in the recent fighting in the Kokang region were Chinese citizens. He said that some residents from the Myanmar side of the border had recently fled to safety in China and that the Chinese government had been helping them out of a sense of humanitarian concern. “China is highly concerned about the military clashes recently in the Kokang region,” Mr. Geng said at a regular news briefing. He called for a   adding that “the parties involved should resolve their differences in a peaceful manner through dialogue and deliberation. ” Mr. Min Zaw Oo, the analyst, said that the fighting on Monday appeared to have been less intense than a clash in the Kokang region in 2015, in which dozens of government soldiers and police officers were killed and many members of the Kokang ethnic group fled to China. As many as 60, 000 Kokang refugees are said to live in the southwestern Chinese border province of Yunnan. Mr. Min Zaw Oo, citing conversations with military sources, said Kokang rebels were now retreating on foot toward the Chinese border, a few miles from Laukkai. But the attacks in Laukkai on Monday underscored how the Kokang rebels and other armed groups along the border with China were actively trying to subvert the peace process, he said, even as groups along the Thai border have actively engaged in it. “I think that pattern may continue for a few more years,” he said.', 'WASHINGTON  —   Milo Yiannopoulos, a polemical Breitbart editor and unapologetic defender of the   tested the limits of how far his provocations could go after the publication of a video in which he condones sexual relations with boys as young as 13 and laughs off the seriousness of pedophilia by Roman Catholic priests. On Monday, the organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference rescinded their invitation for him to speak this week. Simon  Schuster said it was canceling publication of “Dangerous” after standing by him through weeks of criticism of the deal. And Breitbart itself was reportedly reconsidering his role amid calls online for it to sever ties with him. Mr. Yiannopoulos’s comments, which quickly created an uproar online over the weekend, put many conservatives in a deeply uncomfortable position. They have long defended Mr. Yiannopoulos’s   stunts and racially charged antics on the grounds that the left had tried to hypocritically censor his right to free speech. But endorsing pedophilia, it seemed, was more than they could tolerate. The board of the American Conservative Union, which includes veterans of the conservative movement like Grover Norquist and Morton Blackwell, made the decision to revoke Mr. Yiannopoulos’s speaking slot and condemn his comments on Monday. “We initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave, conservative ” Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said in a written statement. Regarding Mr. Yiannopoulos’s comments, Mr. Schlapp called them “disturbing” and said Mr. Yiannopoulos’s explanation of them was insufficient. Late Monday, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to discuss his statements. Mr. Yiannopoulos, who has railed against Muslims, immigrants, transgender people and women’s rights, is a marquee contributor to Breitbart News, where he serves as senior editor. He has amassed a fan base for his stunts and   statements. But by Monday afternoon, his future at the website was being intensely debated by top management. One Breitbart journalist, who requested anonymity to describe private deliberations, described divisions in the newsroom over whether Mr. Yiannopoulos could stay on. There was some consensus among staff members that his remarks were more extreme than his usual speech, the journalist said, and executives were discussing by telephone whether his apology was enough to preserve his position at the site. A Breitbart representative declined to comment. After the video was leaked on Twitter by a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion, Mr. Yiannopoulos denied that he had ever condoned child sexual abuse, noting that he was a victim himself. He blamed his “British sarcasm” and “deceptive editing” for leading to a misunderstanding. But in the tape, the   polemicist is clear that he has no problem with older men abusing children as young as 13, which he then conflates with relationships between older and younger gay men who are of consenting age. “No, no, no. You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means,” Mr. Yiannopoulos says on the tape, in which he is talking to radio hosts in a video chat. “Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty,” he adds, dismissing the fact that    are children. The notion of consent, he says, is “arbitrary and oppressive. ” At one point in the video, an unknown speaker says that the behavior being defended by Mr. Yiannopoulos is akin to molestation by Catholic priests. Mr. Yiannopoulos responds, in an ironic tone, by crediting a priest for having helped develop his sexual technique. Conservatives reacted with near unanimous disgust at the comments. Some expressed bewilderment that conference organizers would extend an invitation to Mr. Yiannopoulos in the first place, given his history of statements that have been offensive to blacks and Muslims, and have generally pushed the bounds of decency. Twitter has banned him. “Colossal misjudgment,” Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, wrote on Twitter. “Now CPAC has put itself in the role of ‘censor.’ And for what? Some clicks and headlines?” Until now, Mr. Yiannopoulos, a fervent supporter of President Trump, had emerged as something of a hero to many on the right, who saw in him an eager and willing combatant against a culture they believed was too politically correct. He became a star at Breitbart, the   news outlet, and earned the admiration of Stephen K. Bannon, who was its publisher before becoming Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. Mr. Yiannopoulos was just getting a foothold in the media. He recently appeared on the comedian Bill Maher’s HBO talk show, and aggressively taunted liberals without much pushback from the host. His book “Dangerous,” a   manifesto and memoir that he sold in December to Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint within Simon  Schuster, had shot to the top of Amazon’s   list, based on advance orders. The publisher had encountered mounting criticism of its relationship with Mr. Yiannopoulos. The author Roxane Gay withdrew from her contract for a book with a Simon  Schuster imprint in protest. The company stood by Mr. Yiannopoulos even as his planned lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, was canceled after rioting. But in a terse statement late Monday, the publisher said it was canceling the book “after careful consideration. ” In a statement released through his agent, Mr. Yiannopoulos said: “The people whose views, concerns and fears I am articulating do not sip white wine and munch canapés in gilded salons. And they will not be defeated by the cocktail set running New York publishing. Nor will I. ” The decision is likely to be a costly one for Simon  Schuster, which may not be able to recover the portion of the reported $250, 000 advance it had already paid to Mr. Yiannopoulos. “Dangerous” had sold just under 50, 000 copies, according to his literary agent, Thomas Flannery Jr. who said he planned to find another publisher.', '”   Welcome to the IGNITION 2016 Livestream   Business Insider’s   flagship annual conference in New York City.

[“If white America experienced a fraction of what black America deals with regarding law enforcement, incarceration, the court system, employment and countless other facts of life, they would immediately and collectively lose their minds,” Rollins wrote.  The former Black Flag singer also blasted the media for allowing what he called “pieces of sh*t” like former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on TV following the   shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. “The despicable litanies of willfully ignorant denial and misinformation I have heard spouted in the last several days by pieces of shit like Rudy Giuliani all but ensure that things will get worse,” Rollins said, adding, “The mainstream media outlets allow this utter crap to slide by unchallenged and, by doing so, legitimize falsehoods that could get people killed.       media is the complete death of true journalism and a catapult for propaganda. ” The actor also argued that there are “at least two different Americas,” something he became aware of when he was in the third grade. Seeing how his peers rushed to grab “free bag lunches” at school, Rollins wrote that “it was in this year that I understood that my life in America was going to be different, not only because of the color of my skin but because of the advantages that came with it. ” Rollins continued to describe a time when he was on a concert tour with rapper   and his band. Rollins said he realized then that his white skin made him more valuable than   and his black bandmates, who had to wear expensive jewelry and gold chains to prove their material wealth. According to Rollins: I learned another lesson many years later, in 1991. I was on the first Lollapalooza tour. It was one of the best summers of my life. I spent a lot of time hanging out with  . We talked almost every day. He is one of the most articulate and intelligent people I have ever met. I wish I had a teaspoon of what he’s got. I also spent time with his bandmates and crew. On days off, or when our buses would pull into the same place, we would eat together. All his guys wore gold. I have no idea what a necklace is worth, but it all looked expensive to me. When we went into places, white patrons and staff tripped on these guys. This is when I understood one of the reasons for the visible display of wealth. My whiteness assured them that I could pay for my meal.   and his guys had to demonstrate their ability to pay by literally wearing a show of wealth.

[“Your cause and your stories are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our borders open at any cost,” Trump told attendees of the Remembrance Project luncheon on Saturday. “To them your presence is just too inconvenient. That’s all it is, it’s an inconvenience. ”  Trump noted that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly refused to meet with the angel mothers and fathers, who have been forced to bury their loved ones as a result of our open borders. “She will never hear your stories. She will never share your pain. She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates,” Trump said. “Hillary Clinton is the  …     first person to ever run for presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around the country that she’s supposed to be representing,” Trump explained. He went on to say: But the media doesn’t want you to know that. So they’ll never ask her any questions about her plan. [It] won’t be talked about at the debate  …     like how she’ll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody  …     She’s not asked to explain what she’ll say to the American workers who lose their jobs as she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law. Trump pointed out that he recently received the endorsement of the nation’s border patrol agents, who have “warned that Hillary Clinton’s [immigration] plan would put the entire country in grave danger  …     They called it ‘radical,’ ‘deeply dangerous’ and warned it would trigger ‘an unprecedented crisis,’” Trump said, adding: Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, social security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for    on the border, sanctuary cities, ignoring visa overstays, closing detentions centers and a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America. Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril. During his address, Trump discussed the crime statistics that frequently go ignored by corporate media, as well as Hillary Clinton’s record of failing to crack down on illegal alien crime. He said: Since 2013 the Obama administration has allowed 300, 000 criminal aliens to return back into the United States and its communities. According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 thorough 2014, nearly 13, 000 criminal aliens were released back into U. S. communities because their home countries would not take them back  …     Most of these 13, 000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton’s watch. She had the power to stop it cold and she didn’t. Now my opponent will never meet with you. [She has] no interest. You know that because you’ve been trying for a long time, for years. In particular, Trump focused on a recent case that took place earlier this month in which a Laotian illegal alien shot and critically wounded two correctional officers in California. Trump explained that the illegal alien would not have been in the country if Clinton had taken action and enforced federal law while she was Secretary of State. Trump said: A few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual was convicted of child rape and was slated to be deported, but his home country refused to take him back. He was simply too bad, too tough, too evil. They said we refuse to take him back. One of the victims has six children, is an air force veteran, and a high school football coach. The other victim is a mother and a grandmother. When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State the matter of this country  …     refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton’s desk. But she failed to take forceful action and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don’t take back their citizens. She didn’t want to get involved. Politicians. Politicians.', 'The airbag maker Takata on Friday settled a closely watched lawsuit involving the injury and eventual death of a woman whose car crashed in 2014. The settlement was announced moments before a critical hearing in which a judge in Jacksonville, Fla. could have ordered the company’s chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, to testify in the case. Even the lawyer representing the family of the victim, Patricia Mincey, said the sudden turn of events was unexpected. “I had no expectations at all” of a settlement, said the lawyer, Theodore J. Leopold, of the plaintiffs’ law firm Cohen Milstein in Washington. “We were preparing to go to trial. ” But Takata, whose airbags have been linked to at least 14 other deaths and more than 100 injuries, has been keen to keep Mr. Takada, a grandson of the company’s founder, out of the spotlight and away from depositions. Takata’s airbags can rupture when they deploy in a crash, shooting metal fragments toward the driver or passengers. The defect has prompted 14 automakers to recall more than 60 million vehicles in the United States and millions more overseas. Ms. Mincey was paralyzed from the neck down after the Takata airbag in her 2001 Honda Civic forcefully inflated after a collision on June 15, 2014. The airbag was among those recalled by Honda less than a week later. Ms. Mincey alleged in her lawsuit, filed the following year, that Takata had knowingly designed and manufactured airbags that were defective and dangerous. She died in April at the age of 77 from complications from her quadriplegia. “The matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties,” Robert Rendine, a Takata spokesman, said on Friday. Neither side would disclose a settlement sum. Takata has generally been quick to settle other cases in which its airbags were blamed for deaths and injuries. But the company had resisted settling Ms. Mincey’s case, because her airbag did not rupture. Instead, it deployed forcefully, crushing her spine, her complaint alleged. In the course of months of pretrial hearings, Takata was forced to hand over thousands of pages of internal documents that pointed to the faking of test results by its engineers,   calculations of potential recall costs and an early understanding of potential safety risks. About a dozen Takata officials were deposed. In a series of congressional hearings on the issue, Takata has been represented by Hiroshi Shimizu, its top product safety official, and Kevin Kennedy, its executive vice president in North America. But the company has continued to shield Mr. Takada, whom company documents have shown was aware years ago of a possible widespread defect in Takata airbags. Mr. Takada said last month that he would step down, but the timing of his departure, and who will succeed him, remains unclear. The airbag defect involves propellants, or explosives, that help inflate airbags in microseconds. Takata’s propellant degrades over time when it is exposed to moisture and temperature fluctuations, which can cause its metal casing to overpressurize and rupture. According to minutes of a meeting at Honda’s American headquarters in Torrance, Calif. unsealed as part of Ms. Mincey’s case, a Honda official pressed Mr. Takada on the extent of the defect in  . “I am constantly worrying how far it spreads out,” Hidenobu Iwata, the Honda official, told Mr. Takada and other Takata executives at the meeting, according to the minutes. “I want you to study the reason quickly. ” An engineer identified only as Otaka pressed Takata on the reasons for the defect. “Why does the propellant deteriorate with age? Why does it explode? I want to know the truth. ” Ms. Mincey had also sued Honda initially, but reached a separate settlement with the automaker.. The mass recalls of Takata airbags gained new urgency last month, when federal safety regulators warned that airbags in more than 300, 000 older Honda and Acura vehicles were at an unacceptably high risk of exploding and needed to be replaced immediately. Takata also faces a   lawsuit brought by owners of affected cars and is the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.', 'London (CNN) The Sun newspaper has sparked a furor in Britain by releasing   footage of Queen Elizabeth II    then a young girl    giving a Nazi salute as she played with her family. Buckingham Palace criticized the newspaper’s decision to publish on its website the private family film, which was shot around 1933, when the future Queen was only about 6 years old and as Adolf Hitler had just risen to power in Germany. ”It is disappointing that film, shot eight decades ago and apparently from (Her Majesty’s) personal family archive, has been obtained and exploited in this manner,” a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. The print version of the Sun, Britain’s   tabloid newspaper, published a still image taken from the footage    showing Elizabeth alongside her mother, her    sister Princess Margaret and her uncle, who would later be crowned Edward VIII    on its front page with the headline, ”Their royal heilnesses.” The short    clip, filmed at the royals’ Balmoral estate in Scotland, shows Edward    whom the paper describes as ” ”    apparently encouraging his young nieces and    to perform the salute, before himself joining them. ”While there is clearly no suggestion that the Queen or Queen Mother were ever Nazi sympathisers, Edward’s links with Hitler and fascism are very well documented,” the article says. The Sun also quotes a historian, Karina Urbach of the   Institute of Historical Research, as describing the footage as ”an important historical document that asks serious questions of the Royal Family.” Source: Queen was entirely innocent of gesture’s meaning, Edward would subsequently go on to meet with Hitler in Germany in 1937, a year after he abdicated the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, leading to Elizabeth’s father’s ascension as King George VI. It’s not clear who was filming the   segment of grainy footage posted on The Sun’s website. Nor does the newspaper say who provided what it says is a copy of the original film, made several years ago. A royal source said: ”Most people will see these pictures in their proper context and time. This is a family playing and momentarily referencing a gesture many would have seen from contemporary news reels. ”No one at that time had any sense how it would evolve. To imply anything else is misleading and dishonest.” The Queen was about 6 years old at the time, the source said, and ”entirely innocent of attaching any meaning to these gestures.” The Queen and her family’s service to the nation during World War II and the 63 years of her reign she has spent ”building relations between nations and peoples speaks for itself,” the source added. Hitler was appointed chancellor of a coalition government early in 1933, and the National Socialists had been rapidly and ruthlessly consolidating their power over the government and the population that year. However, many outside Germany hadn’t yet come to see Nazism as a threat.  The Sun: Images give fascinating insight, The Sun also published a separate explanation of why it decided to run the footage, saying the images must be seen in their historical context.  ”These images have lain hidden for 82 years. We publish them today, knowing they do not reflect badly on our Queen, her late sister or mother in any way,” it said. ”They do, however, provide a fascinating insight into the warped prejudices of Edward VIII and his friends in that bleak, paranoid, tumultuous decade.” Elizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952 following the death of her father. She paid her first state visit to Germany in June, accompanied by husband Prince Philip. The trip culminated with a visit to the site of the   concentration camp, where Anne Frank died, and which was liberated by British troops 70 years ago.', '  NBA   Isiah Thomas said Friday on ESPN’s “First Take” that white silence during times of social injustice involving an   is the same thing as violence itself.  “I look at white silence in these issues as violence,” Thomas said. “White silence is the equivalent to violence in these issues. When you’re not standing up and you’re not speaking out for your brother, right, you and I are brothers regardless of skin color, and this is where this whole race thing, this constructed race thing really separates us in this country, and that’s what we need to get underneath because any type of mistreatment of you or oppression of you I have to stand up and speak against that. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent', 'California Governor Jerry Brown has formally requested federal assistance from President Donald Trump to deal with the evacuation of nearly 200, 000 people from the area below the Oroville Dam, where a spillway is near structural failure. [The Associated Press, via Bay Area news station KRON 4, reports:  OROVILLE, Calif. (AP)  —   Gov. Jerry Brown is asking the Trump administration for federal assistance in responding to a potential failure of a spillway at the Oroville Dam in Northern California. In a letter to President Donald Trump released Monday, Brown asks for help for the three Northern California counties affected. Brown says aid is needed to assist the 188, 000 residents of Butte, Sutter and Yuba counties who were ordered to evacuate Sunday after concerns an emergency spillway could give way, unleashing a gush of water to downstream towns. Though vowing to fight the Trump administration on a variety of issues  —   Obamacare, immigration, climate change  —   Brown has been less hostile than the members of the California state legislature and has openly welcomed President Trump’s plans to spend on infrastructure. Brown’s letter reportedly stated: “I have determined this incident is of such severity and magnitude . . . that federal assistance is necessary to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety” According to the East Bay Times, Brown told a press conference on Monday that he had not been aware until news reports emerged earlier this week that the state and federal government had resisted calls to improve the dam spillway in 2005. Critics charge that Brown has not shown sufficient interest in upgrading the state’s dams or expanding water storage. Officials are racing to lower the level of the lake behind the dam by 50 feet before a week of wet weather arrives Wednesday and Thursday.', 'Twickenham, London (CNN) It was supposed to be their toughest test of this year’s Six Nations, a   grueling encounter against their   oldest of enemies. Yet England, off color so far in this tournament, dazzled at Twickenham to not only retain their Six Nations title but equal the world record of 18 consecutive Test victories for a Tier One side, set by New Zealand last year. Their   thumping of a disappointing Scotland also extended their own record of consecutive Six Nations victories to 11. There were more records of note, too. A   from Jonathan Joseph and 26 points from the boot of Owen Farrell helped the hosts to their highest score, and equaled their biggest winning margin, against Scotland as they retained the Calcutta Cup, a trophy awarded to the winner of the annual Six Nations tussle between these two countries.  England coach Eddie Jones said his team were ”ruthless” and performed ”like the number one side in the world.” A step closer to sporting greatness? This was a sensational performance from a side whose claim to greatness has been questioned after unconvincing wins in their opening three matches of this tournament.  Whether England are yet the equal of New Zealand    double World Champions and the world’s   team    on the pitch is still open to question. Many would answer a firm no. Jones himself admitted there was still a gap between the All Blacks and his   England.  READ: The double life of England’s ’Super Maro’  READ: Rugby’s concussion problem  READ: Italy coach defends controversial tactics, ”We’re not beating our chest saying we’re the No. 1 team in the world, but we aspire to be the No. 1 team in the world,” said the Australian, who has yet to experience defeat since taking charge in November 2015 following England’s humiliating early World Cup exit.  This result, however, would have made the All Blacks take note.  Another equally resounding victory against Ireland, on March 18, in the concluding match of the tournament and England will stand alone in the history books with 19 consecutive wins. A win in Dublin against an Ireland team which ended New Zealand’s record run of invincibility last October and Jones’ men would also secure their first    Grand Slam since 1992. Even New Zealand would then acknowledge them as worthy adversaries, though both sides are not scheduled to play each other until at least 2018. ’We’re vulnerable, we’ve won’ In quickly turning the focus to the final weekend, Jones said his players would achieve greatness were they to secure another win.  The Dublin clash was supposed to be a   contest, but Ireland’s defeat by Wales on Friday ensured England simply had to beat Scotland to successfully defend their title.  ”How many times in your life do you get to be great?” asked the former Japan and Australia head coach.  ”That’s the opportunity they’ve got and it’s exciting. They’re in the dressing room now talking about it.  ”Ireland, psychologically, are in a strong position. They’re beaten, they’re out of the tournament and they love spoiling parties and the party they most like to spoil is the England party. That’s an enormous amount of psychological advantage.” England burst out of the blocks, This is a very good England side. Their quest for greatness ongoing.  Before a capacity crowd on home turf, Jones’ men attacked with verve and overpowered an    Scotland side, securing their place in history, alongside the All Blacks, with a swaggering   display. Centers Joseph, not in the team for the win over Italy, and Farrell were the standout performers. Farrell, an injury doubt until match day after injuring his leg in training, pulled the strings in midfield, while Joseph was the poacher supreme    securing his   before he was substituted on the hour. ”We executed some lovely plays,” admitted Jones.  ”Some of the space created by Jonathan Joseph was absolutely outstanding and it was the work of George Ford and Owen Farrell on the inside. This is a great message from us.” Replacements Anthony Watson, Billy Vunipola and Danny Care (2) also crossed the whitewash as England cut loose with ease against a timid defense.  Much was made before the match of the power at Jones’ disposal on the bench    the combined weight of his replacements was nearly a ton    but with England leading   at halftime the match was over before behemoths such as Mako and Billy Vunipola inflicted further damage.  Injuries, poor defending   Scotland struggle  Scotland had high hopes coming into this match. They had won two of their three matches, scoring seven tries in the process, and were chasing a first Triple Crown   awarded for beating the   home nations    since 1990.  But they were a shadow of the side which had lit up this tournament. Their hooker Fraser Brown was sin binned in the second minute, while star player Stuart Hogg suffered a head injury early on. His replacement Mark Bennett lasted just four minutes after suffering an injury.  The visitors did manage three tries   a Huw Jones brace and a Gordon Reid touchdown    but the damage was done within the opening 20 minutes, when England were already   ahead.  It was perhaps always too much to expect Scotland to burst England’s balloon. None of the players on the pitch were born when the Scots last won at Twickenham in 1983. Indeed, they have only won on this ground four times in 108 years and have not won the Calcutta Cup since 2008.  ”We’ll take this one on the chin,” said Vern Cotter, who will stand down as head coach after Scotland’s match with Italy on the final weekend.

Security barriers  When it comes to security barriers, does location really make a difference? ”If you go to some other airports in more dangerous parts of the world    such as in Israel, Afghanistan, and Pakistan    you’ll often find that security barriers are quite far outside the actual airport buildings,” said Rafaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the UK’s Royal United Services Institute. ”Even before you get to the building you get your car searched,” he added. While airports such as Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion have wide security barriers    and a reputation for safety    this also presents its own logistical difficulties.  READ MORE: Ben Gurion: The world’s most secure airport?  ”The bigger the perimeter, the more people and resources it requires,” explained Pantucci. ”And if you’re in a hurry, all this security and questioning can get you stuck in a big queue.”  Rafi Ron, former head of security at Ben Gurion Airport, said Tel Aviv’s rigorous approach could be helpful for Istanbul given the high number of terror attacks on Turkey in recent years. ”I think we need to understand that this most recent attack is an escalation,” he said.  ”Both because Istanbul airport is considered much more secure than the Brussels airport or other Western European airports. And secondly, as we can see, the attack was very well planned.” Jeff Price, author of ”Practical Aviation Security: Predicting and Preventing Future Threats,” was cautious about the effectiveness of   barriers in preventing attacks. ”If they move the check point from inside the building to closer to the curb, all that does is relocate the area where people can be attacked,” he said. Road blocks, Cement bollards, the thick,   pillars you see outside the doors of many public buildings now, can also be an effective way of preventing car bombs from entering buildings    though less successful in stopping suicide bombers on foot. ”In the case of the Glasgow 2007 attack (in which a car loaded with explosives was driven into the doors of Glasgow Airport) barriers stopped the car getting into the terminal building,” explained Price. ”So they’re effective for stopping one particular type of attack    and not another.” Inside jobs, Many experts say the biggest threat to airport security is ”insiders”    the staff working within the grounds. ”These are people helping others get into the airport, or getting devices and explosives in,” Pantucci said. ”If you think back to the attacks of the bombing of the MetroJet airplane in Egypt, that was clearly the product of an insider,” he said, referring to the plane that crashed over the Sinai in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board. Price added that there are ”many of us in the industry who believe there needs to be an increase in levels of background checks and vigilance over who works in the system.” Double screening, While both the Istanbul and Tel Aviv airports use a double layer of screening for passengers, this is not standard practice in the United States. ”It involves screening before you get inside the terminal, and then screening before you go out to the plane,” explained Price.  ”So that’s considered a higher level of security screening    I don’t know any airport in the U. S that has that.” READ MORE: How safe are U. S. airports? What about the emotional impact on passengers? Rather than feeling extra safe, travelers could also feel scared or alarmed by a heavy security presence at airports, said Pantucci. ”If you want to be in a country that’s open and attractive to tourism, do you really want to have such heavy security at the airport    which is the first thing people are going to see when they arrive?” ”Their first reaction to your county is, ’Oh look this is a dangerous place’    it’s not really the image you want to get.” Looking ahead, Following the Istanbul attack, Price emphasized the importance of reducing bottlenecks of people in public areas of airports. ”A balance must be obtained between screening passengers for prohibited items, and keeping the screening lines moving, in order to reduce the likelihood of an attack in the public areas,” he said.

Minnesota’s governor called for a federal investigation into the police shooting of a black man, Philando Castile, during a traffic stop. Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, above, streamed the aftermath live on Facebook, immersing viewers in the grisly scene, below. It has been replayed more than four million times. With a composure periodically fractured by wailing, she described an officer shooting at least four times after Mr. Castile began complying with a request to produce his registration  —   and alerted the officer that he had a licensed gun. An emotional President Obama said “all Americans should be troubled” by the shootings caught on video this week in Minnesota and Louisiana. _____ 2. A House panel questioned the F. B. I. director, James Comey, for nearly four hours about the bureau’s decision not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Under strong Republican pressure, Mr. Comey reiterated that while Mrs. Clinton’s use of a personal email network as secretary of state showed “great carelessness,” it did not meet the bar for criminality. But he also said a series of her statements were untrue. Those included her assertions that none of the emails were marked classified and that she had turned over all   emails. _____ 3. Donald Trump held a series of meetings with congressional Republicans that turned rocky. A spokesman for Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the meeting had not persuaded him to endorse Mr. Trump, calling the election “a Dumpster fire. ” Mr. Trump also raised a new wave of anxiety about his motives and temperament, hedging when asked about speculation that he might win the presidency but decline to serve. “I’ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens,” he told our reporter. _____ 4. Democrats are seeking to leverage Mr. Trump’s unpopularity among broad sectors of voters in other November elections. They plan to spend $1 million on ads painting the Republican Party as one with Mr. Trump. And several Democrats said Bernie Sanders would endorse Mrs. Clinton next week. _____ 5. Good news for the   : Researchers found that riding an electric bike  —   one that supplements rather than replaces the rider’s effort  —   can still provide a workout comparable to brisk walking or an easy jog. And the 20 subjects reported that their rides were “a blast,” the study’s lead author said. _____ 6. Germany took a significant step on women’s rights. German lawmakers unanimously passed a law that makes it easier to prosecute violence against women. It defines rape as a violation of a woman’s will, affirming that “no means no. ” The measure includes a provision for abuses in crowds, which was added after reports of widespread sexual assault in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. Above, a protest over those assaults in January. _____ 7. One of our   stories today is an essay by a former hedge fund trader on the damage done by pervasive, sexist “bro talk” in the financial world.   comments about women’s bodies and sexual appeal, he writes, produce “a force field of disrespect and exclusion that makes it incredibly difficult for women to ascend the Wall Street ladder. ” _____ 8. Opening this weekend: “The Secret Life of Pets,” an animated,   frolic voiced by the likes of Louis C. K. Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, Kevin Hart and Ellie Kemper. Our reviewer writes, “While this movie never achieves  —   and does not really aim for  —   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of ‘Zootopia,’ it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. ” _____ 9. “The lake was our mother and our father. Without this lake, where do we go?” Our special report on the evaporation of Bolivia’s   lake, Poopó, tracks the plight of indigenous people robbed of their way of life by climate change.

[Although Democrats gained six seats in the House, they lost all 12 Republican districts they targeted with white,   educated voters mostly by   margins and almost suffered surprise losses in their own districts with the most   whites, Politico reports.  Many of those white,   districts have been redrawn after 2010 to make it tougher for Democrats to win in those areas and have only gotten worse since then. Rep. Tim Ryan ( ) one of the few remaining Democrats from those areas, launched a challenge against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, citing the need to change things up if the Democrats want to take the majority. Rep. Collin Peterson ( ) who won 53 percent of the vote in his close race in November, blamed his party’s stance on the deficit, gay rights, abortion, and the Second Amendment for turning off voters in his rural district. “The party’s not going to change on those issues, so the people out there are not going to vote for Democrats,” Peterson said to Politico in an interview. “You might get some marginal difference, but we’ve become an urban party. ” While some Democrats have advocated moving in a more progressive direction, other Democrats have been scrambling to find a solution to how they can win blue collar voters due to Hillary Clinton’s poor performance with that demographic on Election Day. Some Democrats such as Rep. Debbie Dingell ( ) have said the way to win back blue collar voters is by focusing on the economy, trade, and the needs of   voters. “The Midwest is red, and we need to try to get it back,” said Dingell. “Point blank, we’ve forgotten who our base is. Our base needs to be broad. It isn’t ‘us versus them,’ it’s ‘we’  —   but we’ve got to remember who the ‘we’ is. ” Other Democrats said that repeated attacks on Trump and paying attention to only the needs of minority and women voters turned off   voters. “So much of this is identity politics,” said Rep. Ron Kind ( ). Unlike most districts where Clinton lost, Rep. Rick Nolan ( ) was able to eke out a win by   of a percentage point in an area where Clinton lost by 15 points by making legislation his priority. “Someone said, ‘When it comes to trade, and the need for changing the way we do politics, and [that] the system is fixed for the benefit of few and the expense of many, you sound a lot like Trump,’” Nolan said. “I said, ‘No, Trump sounds like me.’ And that has been who I am for a long time. ”', 'Sunday, MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts asked twice if President Donald Trump is trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack in order to “prove himself right” about Islamic terrorism.  In separate interviews, Roberts asked if Trump’s tweets had the nefarious motive, first with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and then with former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. Trump’s tweet about Saturday’s terror attacks in London read, “We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don’t get smart it will only get worse. ” Roberts asked Reed, “The president doesn’t want us to be politically correct, right? So let’s not be PC about this. Is the president trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack with this Twitter rant, because, only to prove himself right?” Roberts later repeated the inquiry to Dean, “I asked this of Mayor Reed, but it seems like the president is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in America. Do you feel that way?” Dean answered,”I just think he’s  —   well, I think he’s totally incompetent. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN ', 'Good morning.

Mr. Hetfield, 53, cited his love of hunting as one point of friction. “They talk about how diverse they are and things like that,” he told Mr. Rogan. “And it’s fine if you’re diverse like them. But showing up with a deer on the bumper doesn’t fly in Marin County. ” San Francisco has topped a number of rankings of cities for “snobbery,” as have several other Bay Area locations. The reputation was even parodied (in gross fashion) during a 2006 episode of “South Park” titled “Smug Alert!” Mr. Hetfield had other conflicts in Marin County. He once angered fellow residents by erecting a fence on his property near San Rafael that blocked a popular trail. In his conversation with Mr. Rogan, he said he fit in better in Colorado, where his wife, Francesca, grew up. “In Colorado everyone is very natural,” he said. Writing in SFist in 2013, the San Francisco journalist Rose Garrett acknowledged that the city’s residents are at times guilty of an air of superiority.

[The first game, Kansas City at Houston, will be loaded with great pass rushers, including the NFL’s last two sack champions —  the Chiefs’ Justin Houston (2014) and the Texans’ J. J. Watt (2015). The quarterbacks in this game better bring their track shoes. The second game, Pittsburgh at Cincinnati, should be an aerial battle with two of the NFL’s finest receivers on the field  —   the Steelers’ Antonio Brown and the Bengals’ A. J. Green.  Let’s take a closer look at these tilts. No. 5 Kansas City Chiefs at No. 4 Houston Texans, Saturday, 4:35 p. m. ABC  ESPN, The Chiefs should be ready for playoff pressure. Essentially this is like their 11th straight playoff game after a   start. They dug out of that prodigious hole with 10 straight wins. Ironically, their only win during their awful start came Week One in Houston. Now they travel back to the Lone Star State looking for an 11th straight. And while they did win the Week One encounter, they are a much better team now thanks in part to the steady play of quarterback Alex Smith, who threw just four interceptions in the last 13 games. The Chiefs enjoy a +16 turnover ratio, the best in the league. In the NFL, this is a stat of great import. The Texans present a huge challenge for Smith with their ferocious pass rush, featuring Watt, who led the NFL with 17. 5 sacks. However, don’t sleep on outside linebacker Whitney Mercilus, who had 12 sacks. Speaking of talented pass rushers, the Chiefs get back Justin Houston, the NFL’s 2014 sack king. He missed the last five   games with a   knee. The linebacker trio of Houston, Dee Ford, and Tamba Hali are a nightmare for opposing quarterbacks. Texans QB Brian Hoyer knows this firsthand. He was sacked four times in Week One, and got benched in the fourth quarter. This   is too close to call. And Las Vegas agrees. The Texans are   favorites, which essentially means it’s a pick ’em game. Vegas generally gives the   three points when formulating a spread. Your guess is as good as mine. No. 6 Pittsburgh Steelers at No. 3 Cincinnati Bengals, Saturday, 8:15 p. m. CBS, With Bengals starting quarterback Andy Dalton sidelined due to a broken thumb, A. J. McCarron starts. The moment isn’t too big for McCarron, who quarterbacked Alabama to two national championships. Starting the last three regular season games for Dalton, McCarron passed for 832 yards, six touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Bengals went  . Helping McCarron, the Steelers struggle covering A. J. Green. In fact, they struggle covering most receivers. They aren’t particularly strong at cornerback. Speaking of cornerbacks, the Bengals face the herculean task of covering Antonio Brown, who had an   136   receptions. “You just get physical with him,” Bengals cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said of Brown. “You match his attitude, you match his intensity and you’ve just got to want it more than him. That’s what you’ve got to go into the game with: believing that you can outplay that guy. ” The Steelers play without their two top tailbacks, Le’Veon Bell and DeAngelo Williams, both injured. Considering the Steelers issues at running back and cornerback, and the Bengals being at home, the pick here is Cincinnati.', 'When Hillary Clinton described half of the Americans supporting Donald Trump as a “basket of deplorables” made up of “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic” people, she opened herself up to criticism about her own “deplorables”: The repressive regimes that gave millions to the Clinton Foundation, many of those   donations flooding in while Clinton was serving as Secretary of State. [From despots looking to gain legitimacy on the international stage to   oligarchs, Hillary Clinton’s family foundation took money from the worst of the worst and countries with horrific human rights records.  Below is a list of Hillary Clinton’s Deplorables. Algeria donated $250, 000 to $500, 000 to the Clintons, Gays and lesbians found guilty of “homosexual acts” can face imprisonment in Algeria. Hillary Clinton’s State Department chided the north African nation for its human rights violations, but that didn’t stop her family foundation from accepting a major donation from the Algerian Embassy. Saudi Arabia donated up to $50 million to the Clintons, Saudi Arabia’s horrid human rights is no secret. In fact, Hillary Clinton’s Sate Department criticized the Arab nation for its “lack of equal rights for women and children” and said human trafficking and violence against women are “common” in that country. Nevertheless, the Clinton Foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia over the years.   Russia: Bill Clinton earned $500, 000 for a speech in Moscow paid for by a   bank, As first documented in Clinton Cash, the former president bagged $500, 000 for a single Moscow speech paid for by a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin. “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?” asks the New Yorker. Russia is renowned for it’s open hostility to LGBT people. According to Human Rights Watch, Russia’s   propaganda law, passed in 2013, “openly discriminates against LGBT people, legitimizes   violence, and seeks to erase LGBT people from the country’s public life. ” United Arab Emirates donated up to $11. 5 million to the Clintons, The tiny Arab nation was ripped by Hillary Clinton’s State Department for its many human rights abuses, including the government’s interference “with privacy and to restrict civil liberties, including usage of the Internet. ” Despite reports of public floggings and a ban on “all sexual acts outside of heterosexual marriage,” the Clinton Foundation still accepted millions from the UAB. The Nation of Brunei donated $1, 000, 000 to $5, 000, 000 to the Clintons, Hillary Clinton’s troubled charity was taking in millions of dollars in contributions from the nation of Brunei, all while her State Department was citing the tiny Asian country for a multitude of human rights abuses, including, “restrictions on religious freedom exploitation of foreign workers and limitations on freedom of speech, press, assembly   …     and discrimination against women. ” Kuwait donated $5, 000, 000 to $10, 000, 000 to the Clintons, This   nation was also reprimanded by Hillary Clinton’s State department for its various “human rights problems. ” And Kuwait’s policy to imprison gays for up to seven years notwithstanding, the Clinton Foundation still accepted its major donation. Qatar donated $1, 000, 000 to $5, 000, 000 to the Clintons, According to Qatar’s penal code, the penalty for the crime of homosexual sex is up to seven years in prison. The Arab nation also has “continuing human rights concerns,” according to a report released by Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Those human rights restrictions include “freedom of religion   …     trafficking in persons   …     legal, institutional, and cultural discrimination against women limited their participation in society. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson', 'Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, where the conversation began with President Trump’s revised executive order on immigration and covered the Iran nuclear deal. [“I think the process it went through this time was obviously more careful, less hasty,” Bolton said of the order. “But honestly, I felt the first order, for all its flaws, was well within the president’s constitutional and statutory authority. I thought the Ninth Circuit decision that enjoined it on a nationwide basis was way, way out of line. It represented the court   what the president thought was a national security threat. ”  “Throughout our history, courts have recognized they lack judicial competence in that area  —   unless you’re on the Ninth Circuit, in which case you’re fit to rule almost anything,” he said sarcastically. Bolton thought President Trump “made adjustments to suit the nature of the litigation,” but dropping Iraq from the list of affected nations was not called for. “Honestly, Iraq is no friend of the United States today,” he said. “It’s controlled, for all intents and purposes, by the Ayatollahs in Tehran. There are a lot of people in Iraq I would give asylum to in the United States, the famous case of interpreters and others who work with our military, absolutely threatened Christian populations and even some Sunni Muslims, who are the target of the Shia death squads that the Iranians have unleashed. ” “This shows why it’s a delicate balance that the Constitution gives to the political branches of government,” he observed. “There are a lot of other things we need to do to reduce the threat of terrorism. This executive order and its predecessor were never more than the first step. ” Kassam noted that the Treasury Department is “continuing to grant licenses to companies such as Boeing to pursue    deals with Iran” and asked if this was a practice Bolton would like to see changed. “Absolutely,” Bolton replied. “This is one of the reasons why I have said for quite some time  —   really since the Iran nuclear deal was signed in the summer of 2015  —   that the next Republican administration should abrogate the deal immediately or at least now that we’re 50 days into the administration, as soon as possible. ”  “The longer it goes on with the consequences of the sanctions lifting and the rest of it, the stronger the ayatollahs grow and the more its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs can proceed essentially unimpeded,” he argued. “This is what happens in a transition when the new government doesn’t take power, because the bureaucracy continues on, as if it’s on autopilot. That’s what this licensing issue represents. ” Bolton said that “the personnel problem across the government is very real, and it stems in part from the slowness of the Senate in confirming the president’s nominees. ” “Until you get the top positions filled, it’s customary not to nominate subordinate positions in those respective departments,” he explained.  “But I’d say also this is important: you can’t come into the government with no philosophy and expect to understand immediately the direction you need to take on key issues like the Iran nuclear deal,” he continued. “If you don’t have a philosophy, if you don’t have a view, the risk is extraordinarily high that the bureaucracies at the State Department, the CIA, the Defense Department will   the new secretary, the new head of the agency. The bureaucracy’s policies will become their policy, and then if the White House doesn’t resist, they’ll become the administration’s policy. ” “I don’t think that’s why people elected Donald Trump, honestly, and that’s why it’s so important to get a grip on the bureaucracy,” he urged. “It was often said, dating back to the Reagan administration, that personnel is policy. ” Bolton said it was not groundless paranoia to worry about the disruptive influence of Obama holdovers on the Trump administration, although he thought the notion of a “shadow government” or “deep state” was excessively conspiratorial. “I think there’s certainly some element of Obama administration political appointees who have ‘burrowed in,’ as the saying goes, to the bureaucracy. But I personally do not believe there is a ‘deep state.’ I don’t think there is a cabal or a conspiracy,” he said.  “I think what you’re facing is a culture: a bureaucratic culture, let’s say, at the State Department  —   I wrote about this in my book after I left the government in the Bush administration  —   that has existed for decades, that is fundamentally divergent from a conservative or Republican foreign policy perspective. It’s a bureaucracy that’s absolutely expert at capturing and   new political appointees who aren’t paying attention,” he contended. “There’s a human element here, too,” Bolton added. “If you are a bureaucrat, and for eight years under Obama you’ve been doing a certain thing, you don’t get up every morning hating what you’re doing. You would have resigned, found another assignment, gone somewhere else. So for eight years, you’ve been doing this. In come the new guys and say, ‘Well, we’re not going to do that.’ In effect, a lot of people take that to be a criticism of what they’ve been doing for eight years. It is a criticism of the policy. It’s not a criticism of them, but that’s how they react. It’s instinctive. There aren’t memos. There aren’t meetings. It’s a cultural issue. ” Kassam concluded the interview by asking Bolton for his take on the political dynamics within the Republican Party as Obamacare repeal is debated. “I have to say, I’m astounded that we’re at this point. We’ve been saying since Obamacare was adopted that the Republican position was to repeal it and replace it, and now we find that we don’t know what the replacement is. How can this be, after all these years?” Bolton exclaimed. “The notion that somehow, we have to accommodate people who have been brought into the subsidy system by Obamacare, and we can’t do what we should be doing, which is reducing individual dependence on government subsidies  —   when did that become a Republican principle?” he asked. Bolton said he was “utterly confused and dismayed that we’re in such disarray. ”  His dismay was not much alleviated by Republican attempts to explain their repeal plan with PowerPoint presentations. “As soon as somebody turns their PowerPoint on, I turn off,” he sighed. John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: ', ' (CNN) Democrats are spending the opening weeks of the Trump administration trying to flex their muscle any way they can    boycotting confirmation hearings, refusing to work with Republicans on Obamacare and pondering a filibuster of President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick. But as Democrats throw every procedural hurdle they can think of at Trump, they’re facing a bleak reality: they have virtually no power in Washington. The party has no clear successor to Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton who can speak with one voice for the party. And there is no consensus yet on a strategy to thwart Trump’s legislative agenda    or even how to prioritize the issues they plan to challenge him on. There’s one thing giving them comfort: Trump himself. The President’s initial actions in office have been so breathtaking in their scope and breadth that frustrated Democrats say their base is galvanized in ways they haven’t seen in a long time. That could make it easier for Democratic groups to gear up for a more forceful effort to sway the balance of power in 2018 and 2020.  Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor, said there was lull after the November election, in part because many Democrats were legitimately shocked at Trump’s win. At that time, Democratic congressional leaders were still debating whether it was more advantageous to try to work with the President on some areas, rather than to risk appearing obstructionist by trying to block him at every turn. Collins, Murkowski to vote no on education secretary nominee, But they were emboldened, Rosen said, not only by their early success in stalling Trump’s vow to immediately repeal Obama’s health care law, but also by the unexpected energy of the crowds at womens’ marches last month and the protests against the immigration ban around the country.  ”It underscored that there was a large community of dissenters out there    it came from the ground up and the leadership sort of jumped on top of it,” Rosen said.  The final straw, she said, was Trump’s hastily announced travel ban, which was criticized as a religious test.  ”It cemented the left’s view that we are not going to work with this guy    the idea that this is not going to be someone we can appease who we can compromise with. The base won’t allow it,” Rosen said. ”I think what we’ve seen is the left and the center left kind of merge. . .. There’s not going to be any tolerance for the middle ground.” Early test, One early test of the strength of the resistance will be Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.   Can Democrats filibuster Gorsuch? Here’s the math, There is disagreement among the Democratic ranks in the Senate about whether to pursue a filibuster that would require 60 votes for the nomination to advance    a threshold the GOP can’t reach on its own. But Republican leaders could respond by simply getting rid of the filibuster entirely, which would leave Democrats even weaker if Trump were to nominate a future justice who could change the court’s balance of power. Meanwhile, Democratic senators in red states that Trump won are feeling the heat, and the White House and their allies plan to amplify that pressure. Trump urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Wednesday to ”go for it” and eliminate the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations.  Sen. Jeff Flake: Senate might have to invoke nuclear option, The weak hand of Democrats was also on display Wednesday morning when Republicans  on the Senate Finance Committee quashed their attempt to boycott two Trump Cabinet nominees, Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary and Rep. Tom Price to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats did manage to temporarily delay the confirmation process of EPA nominee Scott Pruitt by boycotting his committee vote on Wednesday.  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the boycott attempts ”childish” and ”a disservice to the American people.” As they forge a strategy to take back congressional seats in 2018 and 202, the most hopeful signs for Democrats may be beyond the Beltway, said former Obama aide Tommy Vietor. Scores of demonstrators who turned out for the marches supporting womens’ and immigrant rights were protesting for the first time. That fresh enthusiasm has helped ease some of the  disappointment and disillusionment among Democrats about their losses in November. ”Suddenly the idea of protesting is becoming normalized,” said Vietor, who   the podcast ”Pod Save America.” ”That’s the really hopeful thing for people who are opposed to Trump. They are trying to learn the lesson of the (2016) campaign. They’re not pretending that social media activism is going to cut it.” On Gorsuch, it’s evangelicals vs. atheists, The hope, Vietor said, is that sustained protests will draw attention to what he views as the Trump administration’s ”incompetence.” And if the president’s unpopularity grows, he thinks Republican members of Congress will be less eager to support his agenda. Buffy Wicks, a Democratic strategist who was an early field organizer for   Barack Obama in 2008 and was one of his senior aides in 2012, said there has been an unusual confluence of three factors: first time activists taking to the streets, criticism of Trump policies by business leaders who normally stay out of the fray and ”huge surges in members and donations” for established Democratic organizations.   ”We are in a super unique moment in time,” said Wicks. ”The important part is for us now to take that energy and make sure we’re funneling it in the right way in 2018 and 2020. That’s how you actually make change, you have to translate that energy into electoral power.” Legal resistance, Legal resistance to Trump’s actions is also growing, and already has   tentacles with different groups seeking to unravel or block the most controversial aspects of his executive actions. Immigration lawyers from the ACLU and other groups acted swiftly Friday night after Trump released his executive order limiting immigrants from seven   countries. A federal judge blocked part of the order on Saturday, preventing the removal of some individuals who arrived at airports after the order was issued. Lawsuits were also filed in a number of other states. Members of the California Legislature, which is dominated by Democrats, have retained former Attorney General Eric Holder, promising to challenge any Trump policy that threatens the state’s progressive actions on issues like climate change. Tensions erupt in Senate after chaotic day on Trump nominees, Big city mayors in   sanctuary cities banded together last week to denounce Trump’s vague order to cut off federal funding to those communities. This week, the city of San Francisco filed suit against the Trump administration in federal court over that executive order. San Francisco officials argue in the lawsuit that ”in blatant disregard of the law, the President of the United States seeks to coerce local authorities” into abandoning their sanctuary city laws and policies.  They called Trump’s executive order ”a severe invasion of San Francisco’s sovereignty” and argued that the Executive Branch ”may not commandeer state and local officials to enforce federal law.” ”This strikes at the heart of established principles of federalism and violates the U. S. constitution,” the lawsuit says.', ' (CNN) Myth or fact? Coffee is good for you. If you chose fact, you’re right. New studies this week add to dozens more reporting the health benefits of coffee, including protection from type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, liver disease, prostate cancer, Alzheimer’s, computer back pain and more.  But if you chose myth, you’d also be right. There are times when coffee is bad for you, and it depends on your genetics, your age and even how you make your coffee. Good to the last drop, Coffee lovers rejoice! There are more studies than ever encouraging you to sip for your good health.  A huge study of more than 25, 000 coffee drinkers in South Korea shows that moderate daily consumption    that’s three to five cups a day    is associated with a decreased risk for coronary artery calcium. CAC is a great predictor of future heart disease and hasn’t been studied much in the past. Four cups of coffee a day was also recently found to moderately reduce one’s risk for melanoma, a highly dangerous skin cancer. It has to be leaded, though in the study decaffeinated coffee didn’t provide any protection. The study supports a previous finding of a link between coffee and a reduced risk for basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer. Another recent study looked at coffee consumption and multiple sclerosis. It found high coffee intake    that’s four to six cups a day    reduced the risk of getting MS. So did drinking a lot of coffee over five to 10 years. Researchers now want to study coffee’s impact on relapses and   disability in MS.  Add this to the existing research on Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and investigators now believe coffee could be neuroprotective, meaning that it is possible the drink is suppressing the production of inflammatory markers in the brain. And it may be more than the caffeine in coffee that’s responsible. Researchers are starting to look at other compounds in coffee that may help as well.  Coffee may reduce women’s cancer risk, Before you run off to your favorite coffee spot for a double mocha latte, note one thing about these studies.  Most research defines a ”cup” of coffee at 5 to 8 ounces, about a 100mg of caffeine, and black or maybe with a bit of cream or sugar. It is not one of those   monsters topped with caramel and whipped cream. Chock full o’ studies, Coffee has been studied a lot, and not just recently.  The Harvard Health Professionals   Study, which began in 1986, and the Nurses’ Health Study, which started in 1976, have been following coffee consumption habits of healthy men and women for decades.   ”We did not find any relationship between coffee consumption and increased risk of death from any cause, death from cancer, or death from cardiovascular disease. Even people who drank up to six cups of coffee per day were at no higher risk of death,” writes Dr. Rob van Dam of Harvard’s School of Health. Coffee drinking linked to longer life, So why was coffee given a bad rap for so long?  Earlier studies didn’t always factor out serious health behaviors that used to go along with coffee, such as smoking and a lack of physical activity. Today’s coffee drinker doesn’t necessarily fit that mold and researchers are more likely to screen for those behaviors in their results. Make mine a tea, While the health benefits of coffee keep rolling in, the complete story isn’t so rosy. In some studies, very high consumption    six or more cups a day    reduced the benefits.  Some populations can find coffee consumption potentially harmful.  People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes may need to ask their doctors before adding caffeine to their diets. There’s also a concern about caffeine use among youths. And there’s a genetic mutation many of us have that can affect how fast our bodies metabolize caffeine.  The gene is called CYP1A2    if you have the slow version, it would explain why you crawl the walls after only a cup or two or why it might contribute to your high blood pressure. Women should take particular note. Coffee may increase menopausal hot flashes. And pregnant women might be more likely to miscarry    the jury is still out    but caffeine does reach the fetus and might restrict growth.  Doctors recommend only a cup a day during pregnancy. And interestingly enough, the way you make your coffee could also make a health difference    there’s a compound called cafestol in the oily part of coffee that can increase your bad cholesterol or LDL. It’s caught in the paper filters, so as long as you use those to make your morning joe, you should be fine. But if you’re a lover of French press, Turkish coffee or the boiled coffee popular in Scandinavian countries, you could be putting your health at risk. For many of us, coffee is a blessing. And as long as you avoid its pitfalls, current science seems to be saying you can continue to enjoy it, guilt free.  Coffee good for you, but it’s OK to hold back ', '“Republican Wins Special Election Despite Assault Charge,” Reuters headlined its Friday morning article. [Despite?  Republican Greg Gianforte won election Thursday as Montana’s sole representative in the House in a special election marked by special behavior. The victory over Rob Quist came 24 hours after Gianforte assaulted a journalist. Ben Jacobs, the ragdolled reporter, says the candidate (for the WWE Hall of Fame?) bodyslammed him. Fox News reporters described the maneuver as more of a chokeslam. Whether an Ultimate Warrior gorilla press or an   chokeslam, the finishing move worked as advertised for Gianforte. Sure, Trump won Montana by 20 points and the last time a Democrat captured its   House seat MSNBC did not exist to applaud. But really turning Bozeman into Suplex City did it for Gianforte.  In case you never noticed, whenever one dude tosses another dude to the ground on TV the live crowd cheers. The people most loudly booing Gianforte don’t watch that particular   program on Monday nights, so perhaps we should excuse them for imagining the good politics of body slams as bad form. No matter how desperately the scriptwriters tried to turn Gianforte heel and pass off Jacobs as the babyface, the audience would not accept that. Making a journalist a babyface in politics works about as well as making that guy with a Middle Eastern accent the fan favorite in the WWE. Voters hate journalists the way the ticketholder with four teeth in Row 21, Seat B hated the Iron Sheik in 1983. The candidate’s move immediately recalls those of a politician from the American future: President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. But really a president from our past prefaced it. A young Abraham Lincoln famously chokeslammed a wrestling opponent in New Salem, Illinois, in 1831. He ran for the state legislature the following year. Though he lost the election, voters in New Salem gave him 277 of their 300 votes. Lesson? The chokeslam is a winning move. With this in mind, Republican candidates might model all future campaigns on the party’s most recent victor and its most famous figure. Clothesline Chris Hayes. Challenge Matt Yglesias to a test of strength after he asks a challenging question. Entice Hornswaggle or the Haiti Kid to take on Paul Krugman. Demand a   on King Kong Bundy Michael Moore. Twist that guy from Channel 4 into a figure four. Don’t stop there. Change the focus of campaign rhetoric from policy to personal boasts, informing voters of the “             son of a gun” before them. Ditch suits. Instead wear long, colorful robes bedizened in glitter. Fire Mark Hanna. Hire the Grand Wizard, Classy Freddie Blassie, Paul Bearer —  someone like that. When poll numbers go south, reach for a foreign object or tag out. Save campaign funds by instructing supporters to bring handmade signs to rallies. Whenever you lose your train of thought, say “Woooo!” Always speak in the third person. Flex. Cup your hand next to your ear when seeking the audience’s approval. After an ally endorses, turn on him when he’s not looking. Interrupt your opponent’s points by loudly shouting, “It doesn’t matter what you think!” Somebody, apparently, already beat me to the punch here. The Rock recently admitted that he ponders running for president in three years, unveiling a “more poise, less noise” campaign slogan on Jimmy Fallon and appearing with runningmate Tom Hanks on Saturday Night Live.  The Rock, like Gianforte the Giant, enters the political arena as the candidate of the future —  500 years into the future, where farmers water crops with Brawndo and Ow My Balls! rules the Nielsen ratings. The future? The frontier? You say President Lincoln, I say President Camacho.   predate Gianforte, The Rock, and Honest Abe. They outlive Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho. Surely Greg Gianforte could smell what The Rock’s been cooking long before the stench hit the raised nostrils of his critics. Perhaps what The Rock’s been cooking has been cooking for longer than we care to admit. It’s still early for 2020. But it’s later than you think. It’s always been.', '’  ’ ”   Financial analysts have now had a bit of time to pore over   Snap’s finances and issue their opinions, since it released   its IPO prospectus on Thursday. ” ’   One such analyst is James Gellert, CEO of . ’ ”   His mission is a little different to the average analyst. Instead   of Wall Street’s usual      view, Gellert   rates over 60, 000 public and private companies to see how likely   they are to default on their financial commitments, possibly   even to the point of bankruptcy. ” ’   Overall, Snap isn’’t at high risk to default. But it’’s not at low   risk either, Gellert finds. It rated a   meaning a medium   risk. The problem? Its ”core health is very poor,” Gellert writes   in his report on the company. ’ ’   Snap ”demonstrates weakness in earnings performance, operating   profitability, net profitability and capital structure efficiency   relative to the global industry set,” he writes, based on   analyzing Snap’’s finances over the last 12 months. ’ ”   In particular, Gellert says Snap’s capex efficiency is in the   lowest   percentile compared to other companies   globally. ” ’  ’ ”   That is, perhaps, to be expected. Snap is a young company growing   quickly and is dependent on   data centers (aka cloud   computing) to run its company. Last month, Snap signed a     $2 billion with Google to provide cloud services that   guarantees Google a payment of $400 million a year. Snap’s entire   revenue for 2016 was just over $404 million. ” ”   Snap has always used Google’s cloud and has been touted as one of   the Google cloud’s biggest success stories. In fact, Alphabet’s   venture capital arm, CapitalG,  ” ’   However, Snap may not be so dependent on Google forever. In the   fall, months before it signed this   deal, the company   famously hired  to lead its engineering team. ’ ’   Plus, it indicated in its SEC documents that it ”may invest in   building our own infrastructure” and that it is also ”currently   negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for   redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.” ’ ’   The company offers no real hints about who that provider might   be. However, it does say that it worked with Oracle Data Cloud to   study how ads that run on its apps drive   sales of   consumer goods. It would be a huge coupe for Oracle to snare   some or all of Snap away from Google. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”Twitter showed a showed a similar Financial Health profile   back in 2013 at the time of its IPO, but that’s not to say that   Snap is in for the same kind of trouble,”he says.  ’ ’   ”Snap has the unique opportunity to learn from Twitter’s giant   missteps, and if it’s going to have success, it needs to   capitalize,” he says. ’ ”   Plus, there’s no reason to believe Snap will experience Twitter’s   same problems. ” ’   ”The revolving door of management and lack of coherent product   direction at Twitter killed confidence. Their   CEO plan   is a bizarre and controversial decision. Snap needs to convey   direction, a path to profitability, and grow a team that has   confidence and stays with the company to then deliver results,”   he says. ’ ”   Then again, Snap has its own hurdle to overcome: it’s culture of   secrecy. ” ’   ”As a company that historically hasn’t conveyed much direction   and taken pride in its secrecy, even internally, this is a new   world. The public eye is sure to bring many challenges for Snap’s   management team considering the public equity markets don’t like   opacity,” Gellert says. ’ ’Financial analysts have now had a bit of. ..’', 'As gun sales have skyrocketed over the past 19 months, ammunition sales have also surged, with “17, 850 tons” of imported ammunition being sold in the past 12 months. [That is nearly 18, 000 tons of ammo in a year’s time and approximately “2, 865 tons of bullets” that were imported in November alone.  CNN Money pointed to figures from research firm Panjiva, which show ammunition imports for last month were up 200% over where they were a year ago. Panjiva’s Chris Rogers said, “It’s very unusual in an import industry like this to see such a big move. It tells you that there’s a customer demand that’s not being met by U. S. manufacturers. ” Panjiva identifies the top foreign importer as “Poongsan Corp. ” of South Korea. “Fiocchi Munizioni of Italy and Prvi Partizan of Serbia” are next in line, as far as foreign ammunition importers go. Breitbart News previously reported that each of the past 19 consecutive months have been   months for background checks for firearm sales. The streak began with May 2015 —  when more background checks were conducted than in any previous May —  and continued with more background checks performed in June 2015 than any previous June, more in July 2015 than any previous July, and more in August 2015 than any previous August. Month after month, a record has been broken through November 2016. In fact, the number of background checks performed January 1, 2016 through November 30, 2016, was so high that by the end of November there had already been more background checks performed in 2016 than in any year in history.

S.  border with Breitbart Texas after his runoff with   Mayor Glen Robertson. The two were competing for Texas’ 19th District seat in the U. S. House of Representatives currently held by Randy Neugebauer. True to his word, Arrington traveled to Laredo, Texas, and experienced   what Border Patrol agents are up against. [Arrington arrived in Laredo and immediately went with me for the late night tour of   neighborhoods that line the U. S.  border in this city. The neighborhoods sit immediately across the narrow and shallow Rio Grande from rough, crime ridden neighborhoods in the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo  —   a city that serves as the de facto headquarters of Mexico’s Los Zetas cartel.  Regardless of the dangers, Arrington toured the hottest spots that Los Zetas use to smuggle both human beings and narcotics into Texas  —   and he stayed out with us until 3:30 A. M. The tour was no doubt eye opening, as Arrington was taken through the border neighborhoods where very few Border Patrol agents were present and not one single Laredo cop nearby. During the runoff campaign, I had taken the large number of major endorsements that Arrington received to mean that he would be more “establishment” and less likely to actually tour the border and experience what Border Patrol agents deal with. I had seen him as the “Bush” pick, largely due to Arrington’s history of working in the G. W. Bush Administration. Arrington gave me his word during the campaign that he would, whether elected or not, come with me to the border and feel and experience what I felt he needed to know. Truthfully, I did not believe him. My years in politics and media have left me with a profound distaste for the vast majority of politicians and media professionals  —   a perspective that I routinely share as loudly as possible. Arrington won his runoff election by a large margin and one of the first things he did was to contact me to set up a border trip. I still didn’t believe that he would follow through. I was completely wrong about this  —   and about him. He honored his word to me and to the Border Patrol agents to whom I work so hard to bring a voice. Arrington pushed to schedule the trip. He showed up. He put himself in dangerous situations on the border. He experienced and felt what it is like to be out there on the line into the wee hours of the night and morning. He saw the “  rate” Laredo where the police department simply has no police in the bad areas, likely to keep their numbers down and their “official” crimes suppressed for commerce. Arrington felt the unease of being in the brush in areas between the Los Zetas stronghold and Texas. Instead of the politician who was willing to do and say anything to get elected, I found Arrington to be a man of great character who honors his word and takes being elected by his fellow West Texans to heart. I found a man who loves God, but did not use that relationship to win votes  —   a man who will tell you what God has done in his life, but only if you ask. I found a man genuinely concerned with what Border Patrol agents need to best secure our border. Hours of conversation on the border with Arrington left me feeling confident that Border Patrol agents will have a new fighter in their corner as they endure the onslaught of   attacks from many Democratic Party politicians and   journalists carrying out their orders from even further left editors. As with any elected official, we are bound to have differences of opinion over time. I feel confident, however, that Arrington is sincere and will do what he believes is in the best interests of West Texans and Border Patrol agents  —   whether the spotlight is on him or not.

Investigators say that the four men first started fighting over parking spaces, with Morales and others in his car leaving the parking lot while   and individuals in his car followed them. While the two cars full of men drove away, they each started throwing bottles and other objects at each other, before pulling over and physically fighting.

Trump was asked in an interview on Fox News’ ”Fox and Friends” if he believed Obama was responsible for the town hall protests against Republicans this month.  ”It turns out his organization seems to do a lot of these organizing to some of the protests that these Republicans are seeing around the country against you. Do you believe President Obama is behind it and if he is, is that a violation of the   unsaid presidents’ code?” Trump was asked. ”No, I think he is behind it. I also think it is politics, that’s the way it is,” Trump replied. Trump then discussed the leaks that have disrupted his first month in office. ”You never know what’s exactly happening behind the scenes. You know, you’re probably right or possibly right, but you never know,” Trump said in the interview, a clip of which was released Monday night. ”No, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security. But I also understand that is politics. In terms of him being behind things, that’s politics. And it will probably continue.” Trump did not offer any evidence for his claim in the clip released by Fox Monday night. CNN has reached out to Obama’s office for comment. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to expand Tuesday on Trump’s claim that Obama was behind the protests, telling reporters that she would let the comments stand by themselves.  When asked if the White House believes Obama is behind the protests, Sanders added, ”I think the bottom line here is we all have condemned the protests. I think that is the bigger story here, and the focus we should be talking about that this isn’t something that helps and moves us forward and that is what we are focused on right now.” A broad coalition of groups, including Organizing For Action, the SEIU, MoveOn. org and the Center for American Progress have been working to help with grassroots organizing around GOP town halls. Organizing for Action, the group formed from Obama’s campaign organization, has 14 professional organizers, for example, who are involved in teaching local activists skills to effectively vocalize opposition to the GOP’s top agenda items. Earlier this month, Trump told Fox News that reports of his calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were caused by leaks from ”Obama people.” Trump’s administration has been beset by leaks within his administration to the media, and he has continually railed against those doing the leaking and the media since taking office. He has said the leaks are damaging to national security. Approval ratings for the President’s job performance have been at historic lows. A recent Quinnipiac University survey found that 55% of American voters disapprove of Trump’s performance. But the President said he would give himself an ”A” in achievement but in messaging a ”C or C plus.” ”In terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C plus,” Trump said. ”In terms of achievement I think I’d give myself an A. Because I’ve done great things, but I don’t think we’ve explained it well enough to the American people.” The President also gave himself an ”A” for ”effort.”', ' (CNN) Two days after clearing his name, the accused became the accuser.  Jack Daniel McCullough filed a wrongful conviction lawsuit Friday in federal court in Rockford, Illinois, accusing police and prosecutors of engaging in ”pervasive misconduct” to frame him for an infamous cold case murder.   He alleges they fabricated evidence, manipulated witnesses and conspired to win his conviction at any cost. He also alleges they deliberately buried evidence that pointed to his innocence.  McCullough further contends that police from three jurisdictions    the state of Illinois, Sycamore and Seattle    conspired with   County State’s Attorney Clay Campbell and his assistants to gain fame and bolster their careers by winning the coldest murder case ever tried. Judge William Brady overturned McCullough’s conviction and freed him last year. Wednesday, Brady also granted McCullough a certificate of innocence, clearing him for good of any involvement in the 1957 kidnapping and murder of    Maria Ridulph.  Now, McCullough and his lawyers are seeking accountability from those responsible for his false conviction. Among the official misconduct alleged:  • Fabricating evidence, including writing false police reports, • Arbitrarily creating a false timeline unsupported by any evidence, • Creating and conducting a biased and unreliable photo lineup leading to a false identification, • Withholding or concealing evidence of McCullough’s innocence, • Soliciting false testimony from jailhouse informants by promising them favors and instructing them to lie about any promises, ”After four years of incarceration, and over seven years of struggles and difficulties as a result of defendants’ misconduct, plaintiff has been made free    as a formal matter    from his wrongful conviction,” the suit states. ”Although exonerated, Mr. McCullough must now attempt to resume his life despite the horrors he endured while imprisoned for a crime he did not commit.” Those horrors included being stabbed in the eye by a cellmate as he slept. Named as defendants were key players in bringing the case against McCullough, as well as others who played supporting roles: Lead investigator Brion Hanley and civilian analyst Larry Kot of the Illinois State Police Seattle Police detectives Cloyd Steiger, Michael Ciesynski and Irene Lau and former State’s Attorney Campbell and his assistants, Julie Trevarthen and Victor Escarcida.  McCullough seeks compensatory and punitive damages from each of the government agencies, and individual officers and lawyers. Having been falsely convicted by a judge, he is demanding a jury trial.  The Illinois State Police said Friday that they can’t comment on matters in litigation. Campbell also has said he would have no comment. And there was no immediate comment from the police departments in Seattle and Sycamore.  The filing of a federal civil lawsuit moves the   legal saga away from McCullough’s hometown, Sycamore, where Maria’s kidnapping and murder continue to cast a long shadow. Some of Sycamore’s older residents, who were alive when the child was taken and killed, remain convinced of McCullough’s guilt and believe he got away with murder.  Maria vanished from a Sycamore street corner while playing with a friend in the snow after dinner on December 3, 1957. FBI agents who swarmed Sycamore after the kidnapping checked out McCullough’s alibi and cleared him eight days later. He said he was in Chicago and Rockford that day, trying to enlist in the U. S. Air Force. His story was verified by records of a collect call he placed to his home. Three recruiters also told the FBI about their interactions with him on the evening of December 3 and the following morning.  The Illinois State Police   the investigation, targeting McCullough, after one of his sisters, Janet Tessier, called a tip line in 2008 and said their mother had accused him on her death bed. The lawsuit described the tip as a ”salacious allegation.”  State police investigators obtained the full archive of the FBI reports in June 2010,  and it should have given them pause, the lawsuit asserts. But, just three months later, the surviving eyewitness selected McCullough’s image from a photo lineup.  McCullough was arrested in June 2011 the lawsuit alleges there wouldn’t have been probable cause to arrest him if not for fabricated evidence.  He was convicted following a   trial September 2012    a verdict met by cheers from courtroom spectators. An Illinois appeals court upheld the conviction in early 2015 the court acknowledged that errors were made during the trial but dismissed them as ”harmless.”  That left McCullough with one last chance    a   appeal citing new evidence. By then Richard Schmack had defeated Campbell at the polls, and he took a second look. Schmack concluded that McCullough’s alibi checked out and he was, in fact, innocent.  Brady granted the certificate of innocence this week after McCullough’s attorney, Russell Ainsworth, called three witnesses to dispute three points that had supported McCullough’s conviction. Ainsworth was able to demonstrate that the timeline prosecutors used was faulty, that McCullough’s alibi was supported by other facts, and that the photo lineup was so suggestive that the results were unreliable.  Shortly before McCullough’s conviction was overturned last year, prosecutors received an anonymous letter naming another suspect. That investigation appears to be ongoing.  ', 'LinkedIn’s Workforce Report for June found that of the 20 largest U. S. metropolitan areas, Silicon Valley has plunged to 12th place in job attractiveness. [LinkedIn is America’s top job board, with 138 million workers posting profiles that can highlight over 50, 000 unique skill sets. With the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announcing on June 6 that its Job Openings And Labor Turnover (JOLTS) reached an   record of 6, 044, 000 million jobs available, over 3 million of those jobs were posted by 20, 000 companies on LinkedIn.  Workforce’s monthly report provides detailed data on the 20 most important metropolitan areas of the United States, including: Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago,    . Worth Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles,  . Lauderdale,  . Paul, Nashville, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco Bay Area (Silicon Valley) Seattle, St. Louis, and Washington, DC. Workforce’s latest analysis of LinkedIn activity reveals that 1. 31 percent of its members took a new jobs during the month of May. That was up 2. 4 percent over the past twelve months, and the strongest month for hiring since June 2015. The industries generating the largest hiring increases in May included: architecture and engineering, up 21 percent aerospace, automotive, and transportation, up 19 percent manufacturing and industrial, up 19 percent and financial services and insurance, up 16 percent. Workforce has reported that Silicon Valley has consistently ranked near the top of metropolitan areas in job attractiveness due to a “Skills Gap” for experienced computer programmers, integrated circuit designers, and software developers driving up wages and signing bonuses. But the Workforce May report found that Silicon Valley plunged to #12 in job attractiveness, down another 2 notches since February. Workforce observed that only 20 percent of applicants for jobs posted on LinkedIn by Silicon Valley employers had the necessary skills to be hired in August. But over the last 9 months that percentage has jumped to 33 percent.

[Speaking two days after Salah Abdeslam was captured during a police raid in Brussels, his lawyer Sven Mary accused the lead French investigator of violating judicial confidentiality.  “I cannot let this pass,” Mary told Belgian state broadcaster RTBF. Mary’s office was not available for comment, but RTBF said he would start legal proceedings on Monday. The gun and bomb attacks on a sports stadium, bars and a concert hall killed 130 people and marked the deadliest militant strikes in Europe since 2004. Abdeslam admitted to a Belgian magistrate that he had planned to take part in a suicide attack at the stadium, and French prosecutor Francois Molins disclosed this to reporters on Saturday. At a Paris news conference, Molins read from Abdeslam’s statement, saying: “”He wanted to blow himself up at the Stade de France and, I quote, backed out. ” Molins said people should treat with caution initial statements by the    French national. Abdeslam, who was caught by police in Brussels after an intense,   manhunt, spent his first night in a high security prison in the northwestern Belgian city of Bruges. He is due to appear before a judge in Brussels on Wednesday, and RTBF quoted his lawyer as saying he would not seek to have him freed from police custody. “REAL THREAT” Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel demanded answers to the question of how Abdeslam managed to evade capture for so long. Belgium’s federal prosecutor has said the fugitive relied on a network of friends and relatives involved in drug dealing and petty crime. “The immense majority of the population is disgusted by these abject acts against human life   …     so our investigation must show how he managed to hide from police and security forces,” Michel told European broadcaster RTL. Separately, Austria’s Interior Minister Johanna   said that Salzburg’s judiciary is in contact with France about potentially extraditing two militants with suspected links to the attacks. Abdeslam’s lawyer said his client admitted being in Paris during the attacks. He told reporters Abdeslam, born and raised by Moroccan immigrants in Brussels, had cooperated with investigators but would fight extradition to France. Legal experts said his challenge was unlikely to succeed but would buy him weeks, possibly months, to prepare his defence. Belgian prosecutors have charged Abdeslam and a man arrested with him with “participation in terrorist murder”. Abdeslam’s elder brother Brahim, with whom he used to run a bar, was among the suicide bombers. Authorities hope the arrest may help disrupt other militant cells that Michel said were at large. “There is a real threat. There are many, many people in Europe who have been radicalised, who are both from Syrian war zones and those who have grown up among us. There is a colossal amount of intelligence work to do,” Michel said.

[Although the party has existed as a theoretical concept in the Netherlands since 2014 when two Turkish origin Muslim members of the Dutch Labour party were expelled over the influence of Turkish religious organisations in the Netherlands, it has been gaining traction this year. Breaking the threshold of 1, 000 members, they now officially qualify as a genuine political party with two members of parliament, and are eligible for state subsidy.  Eyeing the forthcoming 2017 Dutch elections, the party hopes to tap into the significant migrant origin population of the Netherlands  —   well over one million people in a nation of just 17 million. By appealing particularly to the Turkish population, the largest ethnic group after Dutch in the country, they hope to take at least five seats in parliament. It is reported the party will campaign to establish a national ‘Racism Register’ similar to a sex offenders register, which will catalogue Dutch citizens who do not show sufficient respect to immigrants. But with this increased prominence, comes increased scrutiny. The party made headlines after they compared Dutch   campaigner and parliamentarian Geert Wilders to “Adolf Hitler” and a “cancer”. In return, Mr. Wilders has called the party “a regurgitated piece of Halal meat” reports Die Welt. Speaking in an interview with Netherlands Now, the party’s two MPs were forced to defend their record on Turkey, and a failure to “pursue Western norms and values”. On their refusal to condemn the arrest of a fellow Dutch citizen,   journalist Ebru Umar by the Turkish authorities last month, Tunahan Kuzu MP asked in reply “what’s wrong with saying everyone should abide by the law? “Ebru Umar must abide by Turkish law in Turkey”. Ms. Umar was arrested in Turkey while on holiday, after criticising the Turkish government’s clampdown on dissenting voices and criticism from the press in an article. The Dutch foreign minister later told citizens that if they Insulted the Turkish government and then travelled there afterwards, he could issue no guarantees to render assistance, as reported by Breitbart London at the time. Elaborating on the point, fellow member of parliament and Think Party member Selçuk Öztürk told the website “freedom is quite selective” and that if French   ‘comedian’ Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala could be arrested for his routines, there was no reason why television satirist Jan Böhmermann shouldn’t suffer the same. The comic is presently being subjected to an unusual trial in Germany at the behest of Chancellor Angela Merkel for penning a satirical poem that accused Turkish leader Erdogan for being a   paedophile. Responding to a blunt question about whether the often repeated criticism of the party that they are “the long arm of Ankara” in the Netherlands is true, the men laughed, saying their membership is growing so fast  —   “100 new members a day”  —   they have no need for foreign money or influence. Mr. Kuzu told the interviewer that even if they did choose to disassociate themselves from the Turkish regime they still would not be trusted by the mainstream, as they had been “discredited” for not “sharing the views of the dominant white crowd”. The party has received a major boost this month, as Dutch migrant television and radio personality Sylvana Simons has joined the group, and stated her intention to run for parliament on their ticket next year. The Suriname born dancer has spoken out against racism and traditional Dutch culture including the annual   traditional character Zwarte Piet (black Pete). The character, who has a sooty black face from helping father Christmas deliver present down chimneys, has been a target of   campaigners for some years. As well as seeking to combat the tradition, Ms. Simons is said to be on a mission to “decolonise” Dutch politics. Local news reports concerns her entry into politics will do little more than “fan the flames of immigrant discontent”.', '.@SenJohnMcCain on U. S airstrikes in Syria: “The president of the United States last night showed strength. ” pic. twitter.  Friday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Sen. John McCain ( ) praised President Donald Trump for the missile strike on Syria in response to that country’s alleged use of chemical weapons.  McCain said,  “I would not expect more strikes, but I would hope that we would reinvigorate our support for the Free Syrian Army, the establishment of a   zone, and move forward. This is important, and it is an important signal, but it is the beginning of a departure from the failed policies of the last eight years, and you’re not going to repair that overnight. ” “The other point that I would like to make really quick is that the President showed me that he has trust in what I believe is the strongest national security team assembled,” he continued. “I was not sure, frankly, whether he listened to them or listened to others. I think it is very clear that he values their advice and counsel, and this action is a result of the collective wisdom of some of the wisest people I have known. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN', ' (CNN) The police chief in an upscale community outside Atlanta said he was sleeping when he moved a gun in the bed and accidentally shot his wife in the back, according to a 911 tape released Friday. ”Who shot her?” the 911 operator asked William McCollom, the police chief in Peachtree City, Georgia. ”Me,” McCollom replied. ”How did you shoot her?” ”The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, put it to the side, and it went off,” McCollom said. ”Is she awake?” ”No, everybody was sleeping,” McCollom said. ”No, is she awake now?” ”Yes,” he said. Later in the call, the operator asked McCollom, ”Were you asleep also when this happened?” ”Yes,” he said.   Wife in critical condition, Margaret McCollom, 58, was listed in critical condition Friday at Atlanta Medical Center, according to the hospital. William McCollom, 57, has not been charged with a crime, but he has been put on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.  McCollom started out the 911 call by describing the problem: ”Gunshot wound, accidental, need medical ASAP.” He made the call to 911 about 4 a. m. Thursday. He didn’t mention he was the top law enforcement officer in the town of 35, 000 people until the 1:50 mark in the   recording. The 911 operator asked where the gun was located. At first McCollom said he didn’t know, then said, ”I’m the chief of police. The gun is on the dresser.” ”You’re the chief of police in Peachtree City?” the operator asked. ”Yeah, unfortunately, yes,” McCollom said. ’Come on, guys, get here’ In a statement released Friday, the GBI said: ”Chief McCollom has been cooperating with GBI agents working the investigation.  Ms. McCollom will be interviewed when her medical condition improves. When the GBI completes the investigation, it will be turned over to Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard.” At one point in the recording, the operator asked, ”Is that her crying?” A woman’s moans can be heard in the background. ”Yes, she’s having trouble breathing,” McCollom said. At another point, McCollom addresses his wife, ”Are you having trouble breathing, dear?” ”Come on, guys, get here,” he says while waiting for the police and ambulance. ”Oh my god, how did this happen?” When the police arrive, McCollom can be heard telling them the gun is on the dresser. The 911 operator ended the call. Authorities aren’t revealing many details, but said in a Thursday press conference that McCollom shot his wife with his service Glock 9mm. McCollom told the 911 operator he had shot his wife twice, but the GBI said investigators determined she’d only been shot once. Peachtree City known for golf carts, McCollom was named the police chief in October after being interim chief for three months, reported CNN affiliate WSB. Peachtree City posted this statement on the city website: ”City Manager Jim Pennington said, ’This morning, I met with every department manager, and the city of Peachtree City, including the Peachtree City Police Department, is continuing with normal operations.’  Peachtree City Mayor Vanessa Fleisch said, ’Our thoughts and prayers are with Maggie and the McCollom family right now, as we wait for the state investigation to proceed.’ ” Magazines and websites regularly rank Peachtree City as one of the best places to live and raise a family.

[advertisement', 'There is no reason to speculate about whether nominating Donald J. Trump has cost the Republican Party support in this presidential election. There is plenty of data to demonstrate that it has. Dylan Matthews of Vox showed one way of measuring the toll of choosing Mr. Trump over a candidate who more resembles past nominees. He considered the predicted election outcome for 2016 based on fundamental conditions that have long been known to affect presidential outcomes. Doing this yields a very tight race, extremely close to the   mark. The Upshot’s election forecast and other forecasts give Hillary Clinton a substantial lead, suggesting how much Mr. Trump might be underperforming an average Republican nominee from the past several decades, given how close this election was supposed to be based on fundamentals like the economy and the president’s approval rating. Another way to see what is being called the Trump Tax is to look at polling’s generic ballot question: It asks people whether they would vote for the Democrat or the Republican, with no declaration of the identity of those people. This survey question often gets a different response than a question about specific candidates  —   especially if the candidates are not yet known. That’s because respondents are typically thinking of their favorite candidate as the winner of the nomination, regardless of what the likely outcome of the nomination process will be. In the winter and spring of 2016, Republicans who were fans of Ted Cruz or John Kasich might have conjured up thoughts of a general election in November with Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich on the ballot  —   not one in which Mr. Trump was the nominee. These voters would have answered the generic ballot question with their favorite candidate in mind. When it grew clear that Mr. Trump was likely to be the party’s candidate, it became harder for these voters to imagine someone other than him on the ballot when faced with the generic question. That’s why data on this question give us a different kind of glimpse at the tax Mr. Trump is levying on the G. O. P. The change in results on the generic ballot question for the 2016 race reveals an interesting pattern. Data from YouGov, an online polling organization, show that once Mr. Trump began to dominate the Republican primaries in March and a concerted effort by the other candidates began  —   and then failed  —   there was a significant shift in the generic ballot results. From autumn 2015 to spring 2016, the Republican was beating the Democrat in the generic ballot question. In January 2016, for example, the spread was seven points  —   39 percent for the Democrat and 46 percent for the Republican. As it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the nominee, the pattern changed and the Democratic candidate went ahead. By the end of July, the Democrat had 44 percent and the Republican 36 percent. One way to view this reversal is as the price for nominating Mr. Trump. Similar trends do not appear to be at work on the generic ballot for the House of Representatives, suggesting two things. First, Mr. Trump’s unpopularity has not affected   races to the same degree that it has his own race. Second, the trend among the presidential race is not a general   sentiment. It is actually something specific about his campaign and most likely about him. It’s also possible, but less likely, that the change in the generic vote question is less about Mr. Trump and more about Mrs. Clinton, or more specifically, her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. Perhaps during the Democratic primaries some independent voters thought Mr. Sanders might be the nominee, leading them to hold back from supporting the Democratic candidate until they were sure it would be Mrs. Clinton. If this were the case, however, the switch in the generic vote matchup would probably have happened later in the year when the Democratic contest was winding down. What’s especially striking is that the negative reaction to Mr. Trump by many Republican voters comes largely from his strident language in separating people into “in” and “out” groups based on race and ethnicity. Although this discourse may have achieved his goal of gaining publicity and support among primary voters during the summer and fall of 2015, it is most likely the reason he is trailing in the polls now. A Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday revealed that 59 percent of likely voters thought the way Mr. Trump talks appeals to bigotry. Given that they want to win elections more than anything else, parties rarely make catastrophic mistakes in nominating candidates for president. Because of that, it is easy to believe that who the candidates are and what they say has little effect on presidential election outcomes, especially in this period of heightened partisanship and party sorting. But they do. Just because we rarely see it doesn’t mean it isn’t real.', 'Country music legend Charlie Daniels dismissed Billboard‘s recent gun control push as a “farce” and said the musicians who signed the publication’s letter to Congress “don’t know anything about guns. ”[Breitbart news previously reported that nearly 200 musicians  —   including Jackson Browne, Cher, Billy Joel, John Mellencamp, and Barbara Streisand  —   all signed Billboard‘s letter demanding Congress take action on gun control in the wake of the Orlando terror attack. Daniels did not hesitant to assure fans that he strongly opposes the letter and the political agenda behind it.  In an interview with FOX411, Daniels said: This is the biggest farce going on. It’s just political. I don’t give a damn who signed that thing on Billboard. They don’t shoot guns. They don’t know anything about [guns]. What they do know is what they think is the popular opinion and I guarantee you, Orlando is just one guy. Wait until there are five or six of them. Daniels is pointing out something that all gun owners must recognize  —   the gun control push that followed Orlando was nothing compared to the push that will come after five or six   attacks. In November 2015, Breitbart News warned readers that Democrats and their surrogates in the media  —   including those in Hollywood  —   would use the aftermath of   attacks in the U. S. to justify any number of gun controls, including expanded background checks, the abolition of private gun sales and licensing requirements for gun owners. We got a taste of this in the last nine days but, as Daniels points out, more is to come if musicians and celebrities continue to view gun control as a way to be part of “popular opinion. ” Daniels stressed that the   reach for more gun control is all wrong. He said musicians who react this way should also react to drunk driving by seeking to ban cars instead of drunk drivers, if they want to be consistent. He put it this way: “It’s like taking cars away to stop car wrecks. It’s the drunk drivers that are the problem. You’ll clean it up by taking the bad drivers off of the road. ”   AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

', 'The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) cautiously applauded   Donald Trump’s selection of retired General John Kelly as the incoming secretary of Department of Homeland Security, saying it expects the administration to work with it. [The NBPC warned in a statement Wednesday that of all Trump’s cabinet appointees, Kelly will be under the most pressure to perform:  We have faith in   Trump, and although General Kelly does not have immigration experience, we recognize that he comes in with stellar credentials. We caution, however, that because   Trump’s meteoric rise was built on border security, we believe no other   nominee will be under more pressure to produce. The NBPC was proud to endorse   Trump very early on, and we stood by him through thick and thin, and we continue to do so. However, our endorsement does come with expectations. We expect the new administration to work with the NBPC to solve the historic problems within the agency that have created an environment that consistently ranked at the bottom of all federal agencies in morale, job satisfaction, and trust in leadership. The challenge of meeting our expectations and securing the border will be placed on the shoulders of General Kelly. “General Kelly’s troops, by all accounts, loved him, which bodes well for the morale issue within DHS, and he appears to be a   rule of law General,” NBPC said, comparing Kelly to the nation’s first DHS Secretary, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. “Secretary Ridge also had stellar credentials but due in large part to the newness of the department, and its size and breadth of work, he wasn’t successful. ” Under Ridge, foreign individuals from   countries could still slip into the country    due to federal inaction and program loopholes, leading to criticisms that the newly founded DHS had already “sold out” to    travel industry. Ridge also told an audience in 2011 that deporting illegal aliens and upholding immigration laws, encouraging them to return home and seek work elsewhere, was not an option. “At some point in time you’ve got to say to yourself, ‘We’re not sending 12 million people home.’ Let’s get over it,” he said at Georgetown University. But only five years later, far from “getting over” that millions of foreign nationals live and work in the U. S. in open defiance of the laws —  and commit heinous crimes —  Americans voted across the board to put a candidate in the White House who promised to enforce immigration laws on the books. That gives Kelly an advantage, the Council said. NBPC stated: Unlike Secretary Ridge, however, General Kelly will have history on his side, and if he comes in with a fresh approach —  the   “outside of the box thinking” approach —  and if he surrounds himself with the right people, we believe   Trump’s administration will allow him to be successful. NBPC represents approximately 17, 000 border agents and gave its   presidential Primary endorsement to Trump after he pledged to model border security plans on the advice of agents on the ground, not remote political appointees. “Mr. Trump will take on special interest and embrace the ideas of    Border Patrol agents rather than listening to the management   who say whatever they are programmed to say. This is a refreshing change that we have not seen before —  and may never see again,” NBPC said in March.', ' (CNN) The kaleidoscope of Syria’s   war is changing daily and the latest casualty is hope of a   agreement that would bring about a truce and humanitarian relief.  US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov have been working for three months to negotiate a deal. But ultimately were hampered by ”gaps of trust” between the two nations, according to US President Barack Obama. While it remains unclear exactly what these ”gaps of trust” are, they have been at odds about which groups in Syria should be deemed terrorists and which are legitimate factions. President Obama said the US had ”grave differences with the Russians in terms of both the parties we support but also the process that is required to bring about peace in Syria.” Obama has ’blunt’ meeting with Putin, Too many cooks  Only ISIS is on everyone’s blacklist, and it’s had another hard week, following the death of one of its most prominent figures at the end of August.  The Turkish military, along with several factions of the Free Syrian Army that it supports, has driven ISIS from twenty or so villages it held along the Syrian border, a strip of land that gave the group critical access to the outside world. At the same time, Turkish intervention has ensured that the Syrian Kurds won’t be able to link areas under their control. Now an uneasy   exists between the groups supported by Turkey and Kurdish militia along a broad, ragged front.  The last city of any size in Syria that ISIS holds    Raqqa    is under growing pressure, with US and coalition air power carrying out daily airstrikes against ISIS positions.  To the west, the Syrian Army appears to have wiped out the gains made two weeks ago around the city of Aleppo by a collection of Islamist rebel groups. Led by the former al Qaeda affiliate, now rebranded as Jabhat Fateh   the rebels had punched through a corridor to besieged parts of the city. But aided by Russian airstrikes and the Hezbollah militia on the ground, Syrian forces have regained control, essentially   the siege of Aleppo. These gains and losses go a long way to explaining the absence of diplomatic progress. There are so many parties involved. And most of them    along with their different sponsors (Russia, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, Turkey and the US)    are still jostling for advantage on the battlefield. Why Turkey sending tanks into Syria is significant, What to do about Bashar  ? Then there is also the fundamental divide between the US and Russia that hampers any progress: Bashar  .  Russia    and even more so Iran    have invested heavily in keeping him in power, especially since last summer, when one defeat after another left the Syrian regime clinging on in many areas.  The US has long said any solution must include Assad’s departure. But Moscow appears to have calculated that the US is not going to do much to hasten that event. Last month White House spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated the Administration’s  caution. ”We’ve got a test case just over the border in Iraq about what the consequences are for the United States implementing a   policy and trying to impose a military solution on the situation.”  Assad’s removal is   for a vast number of Syrians, says Aimen Dean, a former jihadist with al Qaeda who subsequently worked for British intelligence. Dean, who has lost two relatives fighting for rebel groups in Syria, quotes an Arab proverb: ”I did not fast this long only to break my fast with an onion.”  In other words: the only reward that will justify their suffering is Assad’s departure and the collapse of his regime. What parents in Aleppo tell children about war, Meanwhile for the Iranians, Dean says, the stakes are just as great. Their influence    preserving a   ”crescent” from Tehran across Iraq and through Damascus to Beirut hinges on the Assad regime’s survival. Some analysts estimate Iran has spent nearly $100 billion in supporting Assad, while hundreds of Iranian militia have been killed fighting for the regime.   The price of a failed deal, So the conflict remains intractable. And for all the failures of the US and Russia to agree a deal, it’s the Syrian people who pay the ultimate cost.  Ten million Syrians have been driven from their homes, nearly half of whom have fled the country, 400, 000 have been killed, countless thousands detained and tortured. What began with protestors chanting ”The people demand the fall of the regime” has become a blood feud in a region where memories are long, Dean says.  According to Aimen Dean, who now works as a consultant on the region for governments and the private sector, tens of thousands of Sunnis living in Aleppo, Idlib, Homs and elsewhere have one question: ”What is it about Assad that the entire Syrian population can go but he can’t go?” In 2011, as street protests in Syria began, Dean forecast that without immediate and forceful international intervention, the civil war would last 10 years and leave a million people dead, sucking in powers around the region and beyond. Fast forward five years and Dean’s prognosis still holds up and for now, certainly, the diplomatic cupboard looks very bare. ', 'Tech news publisher The Next Web continues to innovate in new and terrible ways, this time pushing the boundaries of how conflicted a tech news service can be by quietly setting up its own tech PR startup. That’s right: a tech startup news publisher is asking for money to help tech startups with their PR. [WHOIS information for PR. co, a paid service that helps companies draft and distribute press releases, reveals that TNW   Patrick de Laive was responsible for registering the startup’s domain, and “The Next Web Holding BV” is listed as the registered organisation behind the domain in every section, including billing, along with de Laive’s official TNW work email.  There is next to no mention of de Laive’s involvement in the company on the internet, with only a handful of tweets and replies to people featuring links to the site, without disclosing his relation to the firm. There is also no mention of the business on TNW’s website, and it does not appear on the “TNW Brands” page. And on PR. co’s site, there is no mention of The Next Web. PR. co charges as much as €3, 000 per year for advice with drafting and distributing press releases. TNW, which suffered a wave of layoffs in 2013, is generally   about its inner workings. The site is thought to be bankrolled by its sister operation, the annual TNW conference in Amsterdam. A few years ago, the site claimed it would “stop covering news” before getting rid of the majority of its writing staff. TNW still in fact covers technology news, but the outlet has been trying to expand into more profitable territories ever since the layoffs. Former writers have been known to demand vast salaries when sniffing around jobs in PR, running into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now it seems TNW is simply expanding into PR at the same time as publishing journalism. Asked about the apparent conflict of interest between these two operations, TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten denied that there was any pressure on writers from his sales teams or from staff at PR. co. He insisted that the financial relationship between the two companies was above board. “It is slightly more complicated than [you suggest],” he told Breitbart Tech. “I’m a shareholder in a company called TNW Holding that holds shares in pr. co and TheNextWeb. com. I think we often mention that in articles and posts and whenever we get the chance since we are very proud to be connected to them. ” He added: “TNW and PR. co share a shareholder but aren’t connected beyond that. There is no communication or business between our editorial team and the PR. co team. Our writers are very independent. ” Of course, Patrick de Laive holding a position at both companies suggests otherwise. Asked why de Laive does not disclose his dual role in any online profiles, van Zanten responded: “We just don’t see it as a conflict of interest. ” Seasoned tech   won’t be surprised by this brazenness. Conflicts of interest and low standards plague technology journalism, which is overdue a consumer uprising like last year’s GamerGate, when consumers started to voice their dissatisfaction with the sloppy standards and rampant politicisation of the similarly hopeless video game press.   antics aren’t restricted to tech blogs. Wired UK, the British equivalent of Wired, boasts several PR executives as prominent, regular writers, and its editor, David Rowan, travels the world being paid by the same companies his magazine covers to deliver dreary speeches about flying cars. Unlike Wired, which is at least a glossy lifestyle magazine with  —   at least judging by its editorial decisions  —   no serious journalistic aspirations, TNW breaks financial news about startups and venture firms that readers will now be asking questions about. Via email to Breitbart Tech, Van Zanten even bragged about the other startups TNW owns shares in: “TNW Holding also owns shares in Twittercounter. com and TryMila. com by the way. We’ve often written about them as well, just because we like those companies and their products, and we always mention our relationship to those companies as well. ” Breitbart Tech will be returning to the ethical and professional lapses of the tech press in the future.

Trump vacillated on many other issues, he stuck to a simple,   position on immigration: If elected president, he would form a “deportation force,” round up people who are in the United States illegally and send them back where they came from. Yet even that promise, so central to his appeal to conservatives, now appears open to negotiation. Mr. Trump faced anger, confusion and disgust from across the political spectrum on Thursday after indicating that he was open to letting some undocumented immigrants remain in the country legally provided that they paid “back taxes. ” The comments, made at a    event broadcast the night before on Fox News, were strikingly similar to the views of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fellow Republicans whom Mr. Trump vanquished in the primaries with slashing attacks that they were soft on immigration. His newest formulation also bore a close resemblance to President Obama’s approach to an immigration overhaul, which similarly calls for paying taxes as part of a program to live legally in the United States. For Mr. Trump, the new, more tempered talk on immigration could help convince some    voters, particularly whites, that he has more compassion for Hispanics and other minorities than his harsher earlier positions would suggest. “He finally figured out that you can’t win a national election with just white voters,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Mr. Rubio’s campaign. But whatever the possible gains, Mr. Trump risks offending millions of conservatives who were drawn to his   as an unwavering opponent of illegal immigration. He vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border, called Mexicans “rapists” in his kickoff speech and said every immigrant in the country illegally would be detained and forced out. “If Trump should pivot on immigration or try to redefine amnesty, he will begin to lose support from his original core base,” warned Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, one of the most conservative voices on immigration in the House. In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that he would be open to some kind of path to legal status, if not citizenship, for undocumented immigrants. “No citizenship,” Mr. Trump said. “They’ll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes,” he added. “There’s no amnesty, but we will work with them. ” Mr. Trump said that while his supporters wanted to “get the bad ones out,” he also had heard from   voters. “They’ve said, ‘Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person that has been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out, it’s so tough, Mr. Trump,’” he said. Several times, Mr. Trump turned to the audience in what he told his host, Sean Hannity, was “like a poll. ” “No. 1, we’ll say throw out. No. 2, we work with them,” Mr. Trump said. Liberals who support an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws expressed horror at the spectacle of polling the audience for responses on deportations. “It’s not a small issue. It’s 11 million people,” said Angie Kelley, the executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. “He’s reducing a serious policy discussion to a   vote and cheering the loudest for your team. It’s insulting. It’s dangerous. It’s unprecedented. ” Mr. Trump has frequently dangled vague phrases suggestive of policy shifts, only to accuse the news media of having wrongly interpreted them. His remarks in the Fox News town hall were no exception: Aides insisted afterward that there had been no change in his position. On Thursday, Mr. Trump reverted to his more severe language on the subject, departing from his prepared text at a rally in New Hampshire to again promise a border wall  —   a line he has said he uses when he senses his audience losing energy. And in an interview on CNN taped Thursday, Mr. Trump, pressed to clarify his intentions, only muddled them, insisting he was not endorsing a path for immigrants to live legally in the United States unless they left the country first. Republicans, regardless of their views on immigration, seized on Mr. Trump’s newest pronouncements on the subject as evidence of worrisome confusion or worse. Mr. Bush, in a radio interview, called Mr. Trump’s shifting speech “abhorrent” and baffling. “I don’t know what to believe about a guy who doesn’t believe in things,” Mr. Bush said on WABC. Among immigration   Ann Coulter, a conservative author  —   who is promoting a new book titled “In Trump We Trust”  —   seemed almost apoplectic during Mr. Trump’s    event on Fox News. In her book, Ms. Coulter writes that the only unforgivable sin Mr. Trump could commit would be to shift on immigration. Watching on Wednesday night as Mr. Trump appeared to do just that, Ms. Coulter erupted in a series of Twitter messages: “It’s not ‘amnesty.’ It’s ‘comprehensive immigration reform’! !!! Trump: ‘they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty,’” she wrote in one post. A Trump spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, insisted on CNN that Mr. Trump was merely changing the “words” he was using, not the proposals themselves. Democrats and   advocates, in fact, made the same point. “Details matter, and we have seen no actual policy shift to date,” said Todd Schulte, the president of FWD. us, an immigration overhaul group backed by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg that has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump. Several Republican strategists said Mr. Trump had waited too long to try to woo nonwhite voters, if that was his aim. But Mr. Ayres, the pollster, suggested that Mr. Trump could gain ground with white Republican moderates repelled by the idea of voting for someone who is often accused of running a racist campaign  —   or, given his statements questioning the impartiality of a federal judge who is   of being a racist himself. Still, some Republicans privately questioned why, instead of shifting the discussion of immigration to economic concerns, which polls show is a dominant issue in the election, Mr. Trump has continued to draw attention to his detractors’ claims that he is a bigot. “When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: ‘You’re racist. You’re racist. You’re racist,’” Mr. Trump said in his New Hampshire speech on Thursday. “They keep saying it: ‘You’re racist.’ It’s a tired, disgusting argument, and it’s so totally predictable. ” Mr. Trump has struggled to hit on a successful message on immigration for the November election, in which he will face voters far less receptive to his uncompromising proposals than those in the primary season. A poll by the Pew Research Center, conducted Aug. 9 through 16, found that while 91 percent of strong Trump supporters advocate building the wall, 61 percent of Americans are against it. Mr. Trump’s aides have said he will give a speech on immigration next week in Arizona  —   an address originally set for this week but delayed as he grappled with precisely what he would say. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he would deport only “the bad ones” while letting   undocumented immigrants stay is quite similar to the approach announced by Mr. Obama in November 2014, when he directed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize its immigration enforcement on violent criminals and people who have crossed the border illegally multiple times. His statement about payment of “back taxes” is also very similar to the president’s “deferred action” proposals, which would have required millions of immigrants in the country illegally to pay taxes, among other things, in exchange for legal protections. At the White House, officials who have spent years trying to find ways to overhaul the nation’s immigration system declined to be drawn into an examination of Mr. Trump’s latest comments. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that the challenge for American voters as they considered the immigration positions of the two presidential candidates “is to listen carefully to the promises, agenda and priorities, as articulated by the two candidates. ” Mr. Earnest declined to say which of Mr. Trump’s immigration positions he believed voters should consider. “That’s what makes that question more difficult than it otherwise would be,” Mr. Earnest said.', 'A month after President Trump’s executive order barring people from seven   nations from entering the United States caused tumult around the country, the government’s accounting of how many travelers the ban affected remains unclear. A total of 746 people were detained and processed in a   period immediately after a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 order, according to a list released by the government on Thursday. The figure was nearly seven times greater than the 109 people that Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 30 message on Twitter had been “held for questioning” and Sean M. Spicer, the White House press secretary, said had been “inconvenienced. ” But, according to lawyers for some of those who were detained, 746 may be an incomplete figure. At a hearing before Judge Carol B. Amon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Friday, those lawyers challenged the veracity of the government’s list, saying they knew of at least 10 people who had been detained who were not included in the tally. Some detainees were forced to return to the countries from which they had come, despite having valid visas. The lawyers initially asked that the government provide them with a list of names so they could help people return to the United States. Joshua Press, a Justice Department trial lawyer, said at the hearing that a vast majority of those who were held were eventually allowed to enter the country and were legal permanent residents. He said he could not provide a specific number. The Justice Department referred a request for that figure to the Customs and Border Protection agency, which declined to comment because of the continuing litigation. At the hearing, Judge Amon ordered the government to inform the plaintiffs how many of the 746 people on the government’s list had been allowed to enter the country, and to investigate the cases the plaintiffs’ lawyers said had been omitted. The list included only the given name and surname of those who were detained and did not mention nationalities. Judge Amon had not ordered that contact information be included. “All we’re trying to do is put together a puzzle, to which the government has all the pieces,” said Muneer I. Ahmad, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs. When Mr. Ahmad questioned why the people he and his colleagues cited were missing from the list, Mr. Press replied, “The government is not omniscient. ” Mr. Trump’s executive order was halted on Feb. 9 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Seattle. The Trump administration has said it plans to issue a revised order next week. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn originally issued a stay of removal on Jan. 28 just before 9 p. m. At the time, she also ordered the government to provide a list of those people detained as a result of the executive order. The case was later assigned to Judge Amon. On Tuesday, she clarified in an order that a “snapshot” to measure how many people had been detained should include those held immediately after Judge Donnelly’s ruling, from 9:37 p. m. on Jan. 28 until 11:59 p. m. on Jan. 29. The list provided by the government did not include refugees because they generally do not arrive on weekends, said Rebecca Heller, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. According to documents submitted to the court by the American Civil Liberties Union, some of those detained described having their phones confiscated, their requests to talk to lawyers denied and, in some cases, being coerced into signing forms that resulted in their deportation. Sara Yarjani, an Iranian citizen who is studying for a master’s degree in holistic health in California, was held for 23 hours at Los Angeles International Airport before being deported, after Judge Donnelly issued her ruling, according to court filings. Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who was born in Saudi Arabia and has a valid work visa, was detained at Kennedy Airport for 10 hours and deported, according to the filings. There is an urgent need to find those on the government’s list of people who were held, said Lee Gelernt, lead lawyer with the A. C. L. U. for detainees. He said he feared that those people might be forgotten once the Trump administration releases new travel restrictions. “We’re going to do our best to get everybody back, and then we’ll fight the new executive order,” Mr. Gelernt said.', 'Glamour magazine has joined the ranks of NBC News, USA Today, CNN, CBS, the Los Angeles Times and others in having to publish corrections after falsely labelling me a racist, a white nationalist or a white supremacist.

Write to Milo at milo@breitbart. com.', ' (CNN) China’s foreign ministry said Saturday it has lodged a complaint with the United States over a controversial phone call between   Donald Trump and Taiwan’s President that has overturned decades of diplomatic protocol. China views Taiwan as a renegade province and, since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of China, with   relations governed by a set of protocols known as the ”one China” policy.  This means there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan    so Trump’s decision to take Taiwanese President Tsai  ’s call could risk a major upset. ”We have noticed relevant reports and lodged solemn representation with the relevant side in the United States,” said a statement Saturday from China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. ”I must point out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory . .. The ’one China’ principle is the political foundation of   relations. ”We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the ’one China’ policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint   communiques, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall  . S. relationship.” Earlier Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi labeled the phone call ”a shenanigan by the Taiwan side” when he was asked about it on the sidelines of a foreign policy seminar. ”The ’one China’ policy is the cornerstone of a healthy  . S. relationship. I hope this political foundation won’t be disrupted or damaged,” he said.  Former US envoy: Trump ’winging it’ with Taiwan call, First time in decades, Trump’s transition team said Friday that the   had chatted with Tsai, who passed along her congratulations. ”During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties (existing) between Taiwan and the United States.   Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.” The chat marks the first publicly reported call between a US President or   and the leader of Taiwan since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  It is perhaps the first major sign of the unpredictability that Trump has vowed to bring to   US relations with the rest of the world. The call, first reported by the Financial Times, risks throwing   relations into a tailspin before Trump takes the oath of office January 20.  And it has prompted questions over whether Trump intends a shift in US policy, or if this was a blunder by a team with limited experience of international affairs. Trump emphasized Friday night that Taipei initiated the call.  ”The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!” tweeted the  .  He soon followed up by tweeting, ”Interesting how the U. S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.” Taiwan’s President published a statement Friday night about the phone call on an official website, which she described as an ”intimate and relaxed conversation” lasting 10 minutes.  The two also shared their views on important policy points, the statement said, according to a translation, ”in particular, to promote the domestic economy and strengthen national defense, allowing the people better lives and a guarantee of security. The two briefly exchanged opinions on the situation in the Asia region.” According to Taiwan’s Presidential spokesman Alex Huang, Huang told CNN via text message that both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact, but would not give any further details including exactly when they agreed to the call.  Global Headaches: The 10 biggest issues facing Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on ”AC360” that she wouldn’t go beyond what the transition team statement said. But the   was fully aware of the call’s implications, Conway suggested. ”He either will disclose or not disclose the full contents of that conversation but he’s well aware of what US policy has been,” Conway said. The Trump Organization is also denying reports that it is considering building luxury hotels in the Taiwanese city of Taoyuan after the city’s mayor was quoted last month as saying a representative did visit.  The mayor Cheng   told local media the Trump representative did visit in September and that company was interested in developing there.  ”There have been no authorized visits to Taiwan on behalf of Trump Hotels for the purposes of development nor are there any active conversations. Trump Organization is not planning any expansion into Taiwan,” a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization Saturday told CNN. The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified by name, added that the Trump Organization employee who was there was not part of the development team and was not there for those reasons but for sales purposes for existing Trump hotels. ’No change’ By Friday night, China had already reached out to the Obama administration. White House officials declined to comment on diplomatic discussions.  Ned Price, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, said ”there is no change to our longstanding policy on   issues.” Insults fly when Trump, Clinton aides meet, ”We remain firmly committed to our ’one China’ policy based on the three Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act,” he said. ”Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable   relations.” A different Obama administration official said there was no contact with either the White House or State Department about the call beforehand.  Meanwhile, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger met with China’s President Xi Jinping Friday, China’s   news agency Xinhua reported.  Kissinger    secretary of state from      is credited with secret diplomacy that helped Nixon open up Communist China to America and the West. During their Beijing meeting, Kissinger told Xi ”that he believes it is the expectation of the U. S. new administration to facilitate sustained, stable and better growth of U. S.  relations,” Xinhua reported. ’Major pivots’ The United States acknowledged China’s claim that there is one China and that Taiwan is part of China in a joint communique signed in 1979 at the time of the formal establishment of relations between Washington and Beijing. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, publicly blasted Trump for his actions in a series of tweets.  While it will soon be Trump’s right to shift policy, alliances and strategy, Murphy said, ”what has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy   any plan. That’s how wars start.” He added that ”if they aren’t pivots   just radical temporary deviations   allies will walk if they have no clue what we stand for. Just as bad.” Donald Trump’s dramatic search for a secretary of state, CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that Trump transition adviser Stephen Yates was in Taiwan and was involved in facilitating the call. ', '      Matt Mitrione tells Breitbart Sports that the smashmouth football displayed last weekend between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals kept his attention. [“When I’m training for a fight, I really dissolve,” Mitrione, whom Breitbart Sports glimpsed on a peaceful morning Boston walk on Thursday, explained. “I go to botanical gardens and look at Lego sculptures. I get away from anything that’s considered violence. I have so much violence in my life every day. ”  But last weekend he made an exception and alloed some extra violence into his life. “So, I watched the   game,” he told Breitbart Sports. “Yeah, you’re right, that was an aggressive game, that was a very physical game. ” The game witnessed Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict fight with Steelers offensive lineman David DeCastro on the ground, drive Ben Roethlisberger’s body into the turf and out of the game, and concuss Antonio Brown on an unnecessary blow to the head. Coaches got physical with players and players allege that other players spit on them. The NFL suspended Burfict, with other malefactors possibly awaiting punishment. The CBS announcers, and critics across the country, condemned the violent game. But many viewers found it an intense, entertaining atavism that recalled football of an earlier age. “I think the Bengals are the newfound tough guys on the block, right? Maybe a little bit more hoodlum, maybe a little bit more like a younger mentality, Like, ‘Pfff. C’mon, just gimme that,’” Mitrione figures. “The Steelers are   grinders,” he reasons. “Everyone knows they’re always going to be in your face and it’s going to be a miserable experience to play them. You just have to outlast them wearing you down in order to win. ” Mitrione, nicknamed “Meathead” on The Ultimate Fighter reality television show, fights Travis Browne on the main card of Fox Sports 1’s UFC broadcast Sunday night. The   Mitrione boasts victories over Kimbo Slice and Gabe Gonzaga. But Browne, who beat Josh Barnett, Alistair Overeem, and Stefan Struve, represents a step up in competition. Mitrione played alongside Drew Brees at Purdue and briefly for the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants in the NFL before transitioning to   arts. He says in college he played as a run stopper who thrived on trench warfare. In the pros, he notes that such   games served his purposes, too, in his new role as a smaller pass rusher because they made avoiding offensive linemen easier. “Yeah, it’s football. Like my father used to tell me like his coach would tell him, ‘Football’s a game of bumps and bruises,’” Mitrione noted while employing a fake lisp. “S —   is gonna happen, man. It’s an aggressive, grimy sport. ”', ' (CNN) President Barack Obama on Tuesday reduced or eliminated the sentences for hundreds more   drug offenders. The move brings Obama well beyond his most recent predecessors, who used their commutation powers more sparingly. He’s now reduced sentences for 1, 385 individuals, the vast majority of whom are serving time for crimes related to distribution or production of narcotics. Many of those whose punishments he’s reduced were incarcerated for crimes involving crack cocaine, which came with mandatory sentences that were longer than those for the powdered version of the drug. The discrepancy    a facet of a   war on drugs    overwhelmingly affected  . Obama had hoped for legislation to permanently end the disparities in sentencing laws. While an unlikely group of activists have pushed in Congress for a bill that would alter mandatory minimums and reform the prison system, a rancorous political climate during last year’s presidential campaign prevented progress. Instead, Obama encouraged Americans serving lengthy terms to apply for clemency, prompting a flood of applications to his Justice Department. A group of legal aid groups established the Clemency Project to help screen applicants and complete the required paperwork. An onslaught of requests required Obama’s aides to establish a process for vetting applications, which began backing up in the Pardon Attorney’s office. At the beginning of 2017, 13, 568 petitions for clemency were still pending. The Obama administration has received more than 30, 000 petitions over eight years. The power to grant pardons and commutations is written into the US constitution as one of the president’s clearest unilateral prerogatives. With large batches often coming in the final weeks of an administration, an act of clemency cannot be challenged in court or overturned by Congress. President George W. Bush granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations, including reducing the prison term for I. Lewis ”Scooter” Libby, convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative. President Bill Clinton issued a flurry of pardons on his final day in office, including for financier Marc Rich and the president’s   Roger Clinton. In sum, Clinton ordered 396 pardons and 61 commutations. No recent    however, has used the powers as liberally as Obama to enact a criminal justice reform agenda.  Writing in the Harvard Law Review earlier this month, Obama said his push toward eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and offering clemency to   drug offenders was informed by his own history. ”This is an effort that has touched me personally, and not just because I could have been caught up in the system myself had I not gotten some breaks as a kid,” Obama wrote, recalling meetings at the White House with recipients of his clemency grants who had turned their life around. ”By shifting the narrative to the way clemency can be used to correct injustices in the system    and reminding people of the value of second chances    I worked to reinvigorate the clemency power and to set a precedent that will make it easier for future presidents, governors and other public officials to use it for good,” Obama wrote. While   Donald Trump has yet to detail his planned use of clemency powers, there’s little optimism about criminal justice reform advocates that he’ll continue Obama’s efforts. Trump ran on a ”law and order” platform, though rarely addressed issues of clemency or sentencing on the campaign trail. ”I’m looking at various predictors to try and decide where he might go. He wants to make America safe again. We know based on data that locking up   offenders won’t make America safe,” said Jessica Jackson Sloan, the national director and   of #cut50, a group committed to reducing the US prison population by half. ”I’m hopeful that we’ll be surprised,” Sloan said.', '’’ ’Yahoo is reported to have rejected ”several” offers to take over its core internet business, ’ ’It said the potential buyers included a   firm, citing three anonymous sources.’ ’The report added that Yahoo will most likely announce its next strategic steps only after its earnings, which is scheduled for February 2.’ ’One of the sources told Reuters that Yahoo will present its future plan during the earnings call in order to ”gauge shareholder reaction. ”’ ’The last time Yahoo rebuffed offers to buy its core business was in December, before the board meeting in which the company decided not to spin off its Alibaba assets, the report said.

Since     groups say members of their religion have faced discrimination and abuse because their long beards and turbans make them more visible than other minority groups.  According to the FBI,   hate crimes in the US surged 67% last year, to levels not seen since 2001.    Highly visible, In a statement, the Sikh Coalition, America’s largest Sikh civil rights group, said that Sikhs are often targeted for hate crimes in part ”due to the Sikh articles of faith, including a turban and beard, which represent the Sikh religious commitment to justice, tolerance and equality.” In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh commanded all Sikhs to wear the ”Five Ks” in order to identify themselves as a member of the Khalsa Panth, an army of the devout.  The ”Five Ks” are: Kesh (uncut hair) Kara (a steel bangle) Kanga (a wooden comb) Kaccha (cotton underwear) and Kirpan (a steel sword).  Devout Sikh men don’t cut their hair or shave because they believe you must maintain your body in the way that God created you. Turbans are worn as a way to keep heads covered out of respect when in public and in religious spaces.  Sikh women often cover their heads with a long scarf called a chunni or dupatta.  Hate crime, In the first month following   the Sikh Coalition documented more than 300 cases of violence and discrimination against Sikhs in the US.  Last year, multiple Sikhs told CNN that they felt no safer, 15 years after the terrorist attacks.  ”The threat of hate and racism has become a part of our daily lives,” lawyer and activist Valarie Kaur said.  In 2012 a gunman walked into a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, in Wisconsin and killed six people.  Sikhs have also been subject to racial profiling outside the US. Last year, designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia spoke out after he was prevented from boarding an airplane in Mexico by local security agents after he refused to remove his turban during a security screening.  Ahluwalia said Aeromexico staff and security screeners told him to buy a ticket for a different carrier after he refused to remove his turban. ”I was upset, I had anxiety, I was shaking, I did not speak. And then I realized, clearly, they have not been trained properly. I knew yelling will not do anything. It is about education and the policy,” Ahluwalia told CNN at the time. Climate of fear, According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crime, there has been an uptick of incidents targeting Muslims and other religious minority groups since the election of President Donald Trump.  While the White House condemned the recent shooting of two Indian men as ”an act of racially motivated hatred,” some commentators have blamed Trump for not doing enough.  During his first address to Congress last week, Trump said the violence was a reminder that ”while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms.” But it’s not enough for some.  ”A few words of condemnation cannot erase months of President Trump’s own divisive rhetoric and his administration’s policies targeting and stigmatizing the very communities most vulnerable to hate violence,” civil rights lawyer Deepa Iyer wrote last week for CNN Opinion.    leaders have called on the President to address the attack in Washington, while others have warned that his words may lead to violence.  ”What (Trump) says goes short of being defined as hate, but in the hearts and minds of the lay person is translated as hate,” Mejindarpal Kaur, international legal director of global advocacy organization United Sikhs, told CNN.  ”They’ve targeted their hate toward anyone who looks Middle Eastern.”', 'London (CNN) Happy children dance with a   clown in a floppy birthday cake hat and oversized orange tie, their Eid celebrations a rare moment of joy amid the horrors of life under siege in Syria.

Of those, California officials declined eight and released criminal aliens with convictions for domestic violence, assault, burglary, cruelty towards a child and immigrants charged with drug possession and domestic violence. Travis County, Texas, which led last week’s report with well over 70 percent of released criminal aliens, received 23 immigration detainers. Of those, two were released during the reporting period. The illegal aliens listed in these detainers are said to be from Barbados, Columbia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Georgia, Honduras, Hungary, Mexico, Nigeria, St.   and Tajikistan. The report lags   by six weeks, and covers detainers declined during the period of February   regardless of the date the detainer was issued. The report also details the policies in place that make the jurisdiction a “sanctuary. ” Last week’s report included some counties that released the person to another jurisdiction. The receiving jurisdiction subsequently declined the detainer and released the criminal alien. The reports are being adapted to report this information more accurately, officials said. The ICE correction states: Due to a data processing error, the Jan. 28  —   Feb 03, 2017 Declined Detainer Outcome Report incorrectly attributed issued detainers to Franklin County, New York and Montgomery County, Iowa that were in fact issued to agencies outside of the respective county’s jurisdiction in similarly named locations. Please note, however, the corrections only apply to section I. The data processing error did not impact information on these jurisdictions in Section III. Additionally, detainers that appeared in as being declined by Williamson County, TX were cases that had detainers lodged in that county and where the individuals were subsequently transferred to Travis County, TX. The detainers were then declined by Travis County, TX. These declinations should have been attributed to Travis County, TX. Officials cautioned this report should not be used exclusively to measure a jurisdictions level of cooperation with immigration officials.

Despite Hamas   having similar weapons and backing, not a single Merkava or   Israeli armored fighting vehicle was lost. The reason being   that Israel had perfected the  (APS) to   defend its tanks. ’ ”   The US, on the other hand, has not faced a peer or     adversary in ground combat in decades, and, as a reflection of   that, the US’s main combat tank, the  lacks an APS. ” ’   Today, limited US forces advise and assist forces in Syria, where   no fewer than eight antitank missile systems are in play,   according to a . ’ ’   The most worrisome of these systems originate in Russia and use   clever means to defeat   systems. This highlights   the need for the US to modernize its      defenses. ’ ”   But finding an APS for the US Army and Marine Corps’ global   ground force is fraught with difficulties. Even if the US were to   buy and deploy Israel’s tested Trophy system, there are many   additional considerations to be made. ” ’   The Marines, for instance, need an APS that can be deployed on   boats and resist   corrosion. The systems, with their   advanced sensors needed to detect and destroy incoming threats in   the blinding speed of   conflict, may interfere with each   other or malfunction. ’ ’  ’ ’   Because the systems need to operate in milliseconds, no human can   deploy them. Therefore they need to be automated, and collateral   damage is a real risk. APS uses a hail of shrapnel to thwart   incoming rockets, filling the area outside the tank   with explosions and flying debris that could potentially   harm friendly troops. ’ ”   Because of the US’s high standards of protecting lives and   property, public and private, they must come up with a   satisfactory solution to these issues. ” ’   Meanwhile Russia claims to have developed the  a truly   tank   fitted with a bigger gun, better armor, and APS all around.  ’ ’  ’ ’   While there is reason to doubt the overall capabilities of the     antitank weapons systems are proven to be effective   and in the hands of militias around the world. ’ ’   For the US to retain its asymmetrical advantage in ground   warfare, as it has done for decades, the issue of protecting   armored vehicles must be addressed. ’', 'President Obama’s   legacy looked on track, not long ago, to include a major push against America’s deeply entrenched housing segregation. In 2015, his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them. The move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like Baltimore and Chicago faced renewed bouts of racial unrest. The federal government, advocates hoped, was finally trying to repair a   promise of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Now that rule is likely to be undermined  —   and possibly erased  —   by a Department of Housing and Urban Development headed by Ben Carson. On Monday,   Donald J. Trump officially offered the cabinet post to Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon and a former presidential candidate, who grew up poor in Detroit but has no experience in housing policy. While we know little about what Mr. Carson would do at the agency, he has played down the role of government in his own     story. (“If you don’t succeed,” his mother taught him, according to his autobiography “Gifted Hands,” “you have only yourself to blame. ”) And he has specifically criticized the Obama housing rule. Known as “affirmatively furthering fair housing,” the rule has been politically contentious. Its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and   discrimination that has resulted in poor, segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day. Critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions  —   and demographic makeup  —   of individual communities and a free housing market. Republicans in Congress have tried to defund its implementation. Mr. Carson wrote last year that the new policy followed the government’s history of failed “mandated   schemes,” and would redirect   housing primarily into wealthy, white communities that oppose it. If he is confirmed by Congress, Mr. Carson would have wide latitude to shape or slow the rollout of the rule, along with broader enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. Diane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said Mr. Carson’s interpretation of the rule as a social experiment “reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since 1968. ” The Fair Housing Act passed that year included two mandates: one banning discrimination in the housing market, and the other requiring local communities to “affirmatively further” the   goal of integration. The latter language means that it’s not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing. Communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing markets, which exist today neither in public housing clusters on Chicago’s segregated South Side nor in exclusive New York City suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing. George Romney and Jack Kemp, past Republican HUD secretaries, acknowledged that second implication of the law. But for much of the time since the Fair Housing Act was passed, this “affirmative” mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and HUD itself. The Obama administration rules were an effort to address that   oversight. And some   advocates have spent just as long fighting for it. Mr. Carson recently told Fox News that “we cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner cities. ” “That is the very insight that motivated Senator Edward Brooke  —   another   Republican  —   to include a provision in the 1968 Fair Housing Act requiring cities, counties and states to ‘affirmatively further fair housing’ as a condition of receiving federal funding,” Michael Allen, a lawyer with the   law firm Relman, Dane  Colfax, wrote in an email. The Obama administration rule “looks nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around it,” said Phil Tegeler of the Poverty and Race Research Action Council. Many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities. In practice, the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial demographics, poverty rates, school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether   and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity. The rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists. Those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency. The first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year. Before they’re done, a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this one, or it could simply halt implementation. Or Congress could pass a law defunding it, even as it remains on the books. For all the years that went into shaping the rule, a new administration could relatively easily set it aside. That   would also fundamentally change the conversation in Washington about how poor, segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation. Mr. Carson and other critics call efforts to dismantle them “social engineering,” but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social engineering: redlining that denied blacks mortgages policies that concentrated public housing in poor, minority communities government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further. While many of these policies were first put into place decades ago, communities remain shaped by them today. The “affirmatively furthering” mandate was based on the idea that this history of active government intervention requires an active government remedy, too. A theme of Mr. Trump’s campaign was that structural forces hinder American workers in the Rust Belt and beyond (like the decline of manufacturing, the lack of educational opportunity, the opioid epidemic). At HUD, Mr. Carson would have ample opportunity to show whether he believes that structural forces undermine poor urban minorities (housing segregation, historic disinvestment, troubled schools)  —   and if government should take an active role in pursuing a remedy.', 'Thursday, while speaking with MSNBC’s Luke Russert, Republican presidential   Donald Trump’s strategist, Paul Manafort, said Republican presidential candidate Sen.

Earlier on Thursday, House Intelligence Committee   chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican,  from the committee’s investigation after he   came under fire for possible ethics violations, and some   lawmakers have called into question Congress’ ability to conduct   a nonpartisan inquiry. ” ’   Clinton has made few public appearances since the election, but   has reemerged on the political scene in the past few weeks. ’ ’   On Thursday, she opened up about her stunning loss to President   Donald Trump, saying misogyny ”played a role” in her defeat. ’ ’   ”It is fair to say   …     that certainly misogyny played a role. That   just has to be admitted,” Clinton said. ’ ’   She continued: ”In this election, there was a very real struggle   between what is viewed as change that is welcomed and exciting to   so many Americans, and change that is worrisome and threatening   to so many others. And you layer on the first woman president   over that, and I think some people, women included, had real   problems.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Clinton also revived her criticism of FBI Director James Comey,   who alerted Congress 11 days before the election that he was   reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email   server. Eight days later, Comey  he still would not recommend charges against Clinton,   however his initial note to Congress is widely seen as having   dissuaded some voters from choosing Clinton. ” ’   ”The Comey letter coming as it did   …     really raised serious   questions in a lot of people that were obviously unfounded, but   nevertheless happened,” she said. ’ ”   Clinton also weighed in on Republican efforts to overhaul   American healthcare, which  in March after GOP leadership couldn’t   muster the votes to pass the Affordable Health Care Act, a   replacement for President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. ” ’   ”I will admit that was somewhat gratifying,” she said, eliciting   applause from the audience. ’ ”   Despite waging war on Obama’s healthcare act, better known as   Obamacare, few Republican lawmakers were actually familiar with   what it entailed, Clinton said. ” ’   ”I don’t know that any of them had read the bill, read the law,   understood how it worked. It was so obvious,” Clinton said. ”And   health care is complicated right?” she added, referencing a tweet   from Trump. ’ ’   Clinton soon waded back into foreign policy, demanding payback   for the  that claimed at least 70 lives in Syria on   Tuesday. While Trump has remained vague on his stance toward   Syrian leader Bashar   Clinton called for a swift   response to the attack. ’ ’   ”It is important we take a strong stance against chemical   weapons,” Clinton said. ’ ’   ”People have to know that they will be held accountable as war   criminals, as committing crimes against humanity, if they engage   in these kinds of aggressive, violent acts.” ’ ’   When asked whether she would run for office again, Clinton said   she ”likely” will not, focusing instead on helping Democrats   regain a majority in Congress. ’ ’In one of her most candid speaking appearances. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’', 'MADRID (AFP)  —   Troublemakers sparked panic sparked at Seville’s nighttime Good Friday processions, famed for their religious floats, hooded penitents and crowds of spectators, seriously injuring one person, Spanish authorities said. [Emergency services said eight people were detained in connection with the incidents, from 04:00 local time (0200GMT) on Friday, which sent people running in panic and leaving children in tears along procession routes throughout the city .  One man was later released, though he could still face charges, authorities in the southern Spanish city said. In a statement, the Cecop centre that oversees security during the annual processions said those detained had “shouted” used metallic objects to make loud noise or made “wild gesticulations” to create panic in the   crowds. An AFP photographer present said she heard what sounded like a stampede of galloping animals, and then a mass of people pushed towards her. Standing on the Isabel II bridge that straddles Seville’s Guadalquivir River, she climbed onto a lamppost. “There were children, women with prams,” she said, adding that some people rushed down steps towards the river, falling over themselves in panic. “The first thing people think is that there is a terrorist attack. ” Spanish media reported that some of those later detained shouted “Allah is great” as well as slogans in favour of the Basque separatist group ETA. But Ricardo   the central government’s representative in Seville, said there was no link to extremism. “It’s got nothing to do with Islamist groups, ETA, or any known terrorist group,” he told reporters in comments broadcast on Spanish television. “They wanted to create the utmost panic with their shouting,” he added. An initial probe showed that there were three initial movements of panic, which sparked a “domino effect” in other parts of the city, Cecop said. “These are isolated cases without any apparent connection that are similar to cases of vandalism and hooliganism,” it said. The situation was later brought back under control and the processions continued. Cecop said three of those arrested were “common delinquents”. Some 17 people were taken to hospital for injuries and panic attacks, it said. One of them was in intensive care in a serious condition with a head injury. Organised by religious brotherhoods and featuring huge floats of wooden sculptures of religious scenes accompanied by hooded penitents, the processions known as “La Madruga” are the high point of Easter Week festivities in Seville. This morning’s early incident mirrors a similar outbreak of panic in 2000 in Seville’s Good Friday processions, which left 52 people injured. Good Friday is the second of four intensive days in the Christian calendar culminating in Easter Sunday, which commemorates Christ’s resurrection.', 'Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan conceded the biggest defeat of his political career Friday: Republicans have failed to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And after nearly three full months into the year, he now has to face a   a challenge that is likely to haunt his tenure as speaker for the foreseeable future: seemingly irreconcilable differences among his fellow Republicans.  ”Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,” Ryan told reporters Friday. ”And well, we’re feeling those growing pains today.” The stunning setback was particularly excruciating for the    who made his name in Washington as a conservative policy wonk committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act and ascended to the powerful position of House speaker in fall 2015. The bill that too many of his fellow colleagues ultimately rejected was based on Ryan’s signature policy agenda, called ”A Better Way.”     ”I don’t know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land. It’ll remain law of the land until it’s replaced,” he said. ”We’re going to be living with Obamacre for the foreseeable future.” It’s a rough reminder that life is different for Ryan now than before Trump was elected. During the Obama administration, the   House could pass message bills that would repeal Obamacare with impunity, knowing they would die in the Senate or be vetoed by the President.  ”This is how governing works when you’re in the majority. We need to get 216 people to agree with each other to write legislation. Not 210. Not 215,” Ryan said at Friday’s press conference. ”We were close but we didn’t have 216 people. That’s how legislating works.” RELATED: Dems gleeful after Obamacare victory, Even before the decision to pull the health care bill, Republican lawmakers were worried about the impact of a potential defeat.  New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday afternoon prior to the cancellation of the vote that if the health care bill fails, it would leave a ”black eye” on his party’s ability to legislate. ”If we don’t pass this, I personally don’t think we pass a 2018 budget. We couldn’t pass a 2017 budget. So if we couldn’t pass a 2017 budget and this happens today, how are we going to pass a 2018 budget?” he said. ”And that’s the vehicle for tax reform. And if you don’t do tax reform, where does the money come from for infrastructure? That’s how critical this vote is today.”  But both Trump and Ryan say they plan to go to tax reform next. Ryan spoke alone from behind the podium, and he was not flanked by any of the Republican colleagues or White House officials who had furiously worked with him for weeks to try to get the health care legislation through the House.  And while questions are being raised about Ryan’s relationship with Trump, the two have publicly insisted that they have a healthy dialogue. The Wisconsin Republican said he had directly informed Trump that he did not have the votes, and that the President accepted his recommendation that Republicans yank the bill.  Trump publicly blamed Democrats    not the speaker    for Friday’s failure. ”I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,” Trump said from the Oval Office. RELATED: Trump ready to cast blame, But it will take more than platitudes to unite his party, especially after both conservative and moderate factions demonstrated their strength this week. The GOP’s internal divisions were Ryan’s gravest challenge, and one he never came close to resolving.  Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus refused to get behind the bill, referring to leadership’s proposal as ”Obamacare Lite” that simply didn’t go far enough in gutting the law.  But when Ryan and his deputies attempted to appease that faction by offering to go further than their original bill in gutting Obamacare, that only irked the more moderate lawmakers in the House conference.  In the final days, Ryan worked around the clock to try to bridge the two factions, holding    meetings and    sessions. But the differences could not be reconciled.   ”We came really close today, but we came up short,” Ryan said at a news conference. ”I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us.” ', '”The world is about to have a good   glut on its hands, courtesy of China’s problematic economy. ” ’And the world is already starting to feel the pain.’ ”The problem is that China’s got too many companies producing things like coal and steel, and the   enterprises (SOEs) doing this have racked up debt that’s now eating up their profits. ” ’The government is trying to shift the whole economy from its dependence on manufacturing, and it has already said that  in some of these industries are going to be laid off in the next few years.’ ”But China can’t just shutter these companies overnight, because they still need to pay back the banks holding their debt and it would be an unmitigated disaster for employment. ” ”So these products have to go somewhere, and that means they’re going to be exported to the world.

[Professor of political science at one of France’s most prestigious universities, Sciences Po, Gilles Kepel, claims that the current wave of Islamic terrorism in Europe is not so much a war of Western civilization against Islam, but a war within Islam itself.  The result is an entire generation, adherents of the extremist Wahabist and Salafist movements, who want not only to take over Europe, but to eliminate more moderate Islamic opposition, reports Die Welt. Prof. Kepel foresees that the growing number of Muslims, who are forming what he calls the “Jihad Generation” will likely continue to commit acts of terror in European cities. The goal of the terror is not to provoke political change, but rather to incite hatred toward Muslims from the rest of society, which he believes would eventually radicalise enough Muslims to the point that Europe could enter into a   civil war. The   goal of the Jihad Generation is to destroy Europe through civil war and then build an Islamic society from the ashes, Prof. Kepel said. The strategy is similar to the expansion of Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and Libya where the terrorist organisation was able to use the chaos of civil war to slowly build its forces, grow in power, and rapidly seize territory. While Prof. Kepel says that most Muslims do not actively participate in terrorism or with terrorist groups, he says that the growth of Salafism among young people, combined with a sense of entitlement and lack of job prospects, means that   Muslims will be far more likely to join radical groups. Salafism as an ideology is dangerous, Prof. Kepel maintains, because it preaches that Westerners are “unbelievers” and encourages a path toward violence. The consequences for the unchecked growth of Salafism among young people could not only lead to civil war, but perhaps to the end of Islam in Europe, with the academic noting the rise of an extreme, nationalistic,   ideology among Europeans as just as much a possibility. Islamic intellectuals are also not doing enough to combat the Salafist ideology, according to Prof. Kepel. The scholar stated that mainstream imams have a duty to reject Salafist teachings and while some do, he says the vast majority are silent on the issue. Salafist preachers have become the target of raids in parts of Germany in recent months as the government is finding more and more preachers with links to Islamic State such as notorious preacher Sven Lau. There is also a fear among law makers and police that the increasing number of young migrants crossing from the Middle East and North Africa may be even more susceptible to Salafist teachings as their expectations of an easy life in Europe are not met. Authorities have even caught Salafists attempting to convert and recruit migrants by visiting asylum homes.', 'Although the historic nature of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to Pearl Harbor this week is stressed by both American and Japanese officials, he is not actually the first Prime Minister of Japan to make such a visit. [Japan’s The Mainichi daily reports Tokyo has confirmed three of Abe’s predecessors made Pearl Harbor visits in the 1950s, despite public announcements that Abe would be the first.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the Japanese Foreign Ministry has “confirmed materials” documenting visits by Shigeru Yoshida, Ichiro Hatoyama, and Nobusuke Kishi, who was Shinzo Abe’s grandfather. Photographs of Hatoyama and Kishi’s visits were published by Japanese media last week, producing a bit of a stir among the public, due to unequivocal statements by their government that Abe was the first sitting PM to make such a visit. Abe will certainly be the first Japanese Prime Minister to pay public tribute at the USS Arizona memorial. “Prime Minister Abe would also be the first to mourn the victims jointly with a U. S. president,” added Suga. The Associated Press recounts Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida’s visit in 1951, just six years after Japan surrendered in World War II. He was on his way home after signing a historic peace treaty in San Francisco, and asked to pay a courtesy call on Admiral Arthur Radford, commander of the U. S. Pacific Fleet. The meeting was a little tense at first, because Radford’s office overlooked the wreckage of the Arizona, but his Scottish terrier broke the ice by making friends with dog fancier Yoshida. “Years later, Yoshida told Radford’s wife how he was embarrassed when he walked into the office after seeing Pearl Harbor, and how happy he was that the dog was able to settle him down,” the AP writes. The New York Times notes in a report on the significance of Abe’s   visit to Pearl Harbor that Japanese students of today are taught surprisingly little about the attack. “Most young people don’t know much about the war,” said history teacher Katsutoshi Chujo. “They know about Japan as a victim in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Tokyo air raids. ” “Several textbooks used in public schools describe it as a surprise attack on the United States that followed a long campaign in China. But a textbook that takes a more nationalist view and that has been approved by the Education Ministry portrays the attacks as being forced by American demands and describes Japan as waging a war of ‘’” the New York Times reports. The NYT also observes that while Japanese “nationalist right wing” groups scuttled Emperor Akihito’s plans to visit the USS Arizona memorial in 1994, those quarters of the Japanese political spectrum seem comfortable with Abe finally making a public visit, with one Japanese “ ” paper editorializing that it would present “an opportunity to refresh a commitment to deepen the U. S.  friendship and contribute peace to the world through a tranquil ceremony. ” Bloomberg News  —   which quietly acknowledges the fresh details about   PM visits in the past by describing Abe’s visit as “the first by a sitting Japanese prime minister in decades”  —   anticipates he will use the event to kick off a year focused more heavily on foreign policy and diplomacy than domestic economic concerns. Like the New York Times, Bloomberg mentions that Japanese politicians are nervous about   Donald Trump’s criticism that U. S. allies are not shouldering enough of the burden for their defense, especially with the growing Chinese threat in the South and East China Seas. Trump’s critique of the   Partnership trade deal is also mentioned as a cause for concern by Abe, who strongly supports TPP. This transforms Abe, “long seen as a nationalist and traditionalist” in Bloomberg’s estimation, into a champion of globalism and internationalism. It will interesting to see what he’s prepared to do, in order to preserve a relationship with the United States grown more vital than ever, beginning with what he’s prepared to say at the USS Arizona memorial.', '’Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton notched another win in a key primary state.’ ”Shortly after polls closed in Mississippi on Tuesday night, multiple networks projected that the former secretary of state would win the state’s primary.” ”Clinton likely secured the majority of Mississippi’s 36 delegates, putting her even closer to winning the 2, 383 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination.” ’She quickly thanked her supporters in the state,  of MSNBC projecting her victory.’ ”Clinton has dominated among   voters, who have an outsize influence among Southern states. According to CNN exit polls, Clinton won almost 90% of black voters in Mississippi, who made up the majority of the state’s Democratic primary voters.” ’She has easily defeated rival Bernie Sanders in all of the Southern contests so far, including Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia.’ ’Sanders, a Vermont senator, is hoping to do better in Michigan, the only other state hosting a Democratic primary on Tuesday.’ ’Democratic presidential candidate Hillary. ..’', 'Good morning.

Polls show a tight race nationally and in swing states, though early voting data bodes well for Hillary Clinton. We boarded Donald J. Trump’s plane for an inside look at his last stand. He’s betting big on less educated white voters. And even if he loses, his campaign’s legacy will live on, in the form of emboldened extremists. Here’s our live coverage of the last hours of the race. We’re offering unlimited access to NYTimes. com for the election, from now through Thursday morning. _____ • Hong Kong is bracing for street protests and tough questions about the independence of its courts after China barred two   city politicians from taking their seats in the legislature. The move could open an era in which Hong Kong’s elected officials can be punished if they fail to meet a vague standard of political loyalty to the central government. _____ • China’s new cybersecurity law gives the authorities far greater control over the internet as of next summer. Its requirements  —   including real names for messaging services and security checks in the finance and communication industries  —   are raising concerns about freedom of speech and barriers to foreign businesses. _____ • Australia will not legalize   marriage anytime soon. A bill that would have allowed for a plebiscite on the issue was shot down in Parliament over the $140 million cost and concerns that it would become a platform for hate speech. Polls show around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality, and many supporters of legalization want action in Parliament, not a nonbinding plebiscite. _____ • Heavy smog continues to choke New Delhi, where schools are closed and emergency measures are in place to improve air quality that is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Asked where she lived, a New Delhi resident said, “a gas chamber. ” _____ • The Philippine Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether President Rodrigo Duterte may transfer the remains of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the country’s former dictator, to a heroes’ cemetery in Manila. The justices have another Duterte case on the docket: a senator who has often been critical of him has asked the court for an order to stop him from retaliating with verbal attacks, which have included speeches in which he called her a “dirty woman” and discussed her private life. • Warner Bros. a division of Time Warner, is often in the shadow of its sibling HBO. Kevin Tsujihara, above right, the film studio’s chief executive, wants to change all that. He is on pace to deliver record operating profit and may have a hit with the new J. K. Rowling film, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. ” • China will release its balance of trade figures  —   how its exports and imports compare  —   for October, offering another data point for the health of the country’s economy. • The Sotheby’s auction house reported a loss of $54 million in the third quarter, citing a slowdown in the art market and the purchase of an advisory business. • U. S. markets surged on election news, and the dollar was up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, was   to a third term in an election that many disaffected voters simply ignored. [The Wall Street Journal] • A German sailing couple, who were seized and held for ransom eight years ago by Somali pirates, were reported to have been abducted again in dangerous waters near the Philippines.

S. attorney general, died at age 78. She played a major role in some of the most divisive episodes of the presidency of Bill Clinton. • The world’s youngest chess grandmaster,    Sergey Karjakin of Russia, is about to challenge the reigning world champion in New York. • A new study finds that whale songs need to be felt as well as heard. The sounds are accompanied by vibrations that course hundreds if not thousands of feet through the water, possibly enhancing    communication. • A Chinese Paralympic champion was nowhere to be seen at the finish of the New York City Marathon. Turned out her wheelchair had blown a tire at Mile 13  —   so three people, aided by a translation app, stepped in to help. “It really was a cool New York moment,” one said. Britons have been saying a lot of goodbyes in the past few months. They voted to leave the European Union. The prime minister resigned. The leading figures of the “Brexit” campaign departed the government. And through all this, the news media outside Britain found one expression that worked in multiple languages: “English leave. ” It’s a play on “taking French leave,” which the British use to mean departing abruptly  —   supposedly a reference to the French manner of leaving a social function without saying goodbye. Such nationalist expressions abounded around the 19th century, when rival nations in a disunited Europe settled scores in wars, revolutions and slights. But the Germans also pick on the Poles for evaporating from parties, which the British call an “Irish goodbye. ” (The German weekly “Die Zeit” even graphed the zingers and  .) Of course, the slaps don’t end with departures. Germans can mention, though rarely, “English shopping”  —   that is, theft, as in the colonial past. And references to historic battles get drawn into the mix, too. So the French could say, depending on how Brexit works out, “c’est un vrai coup de Trafalgar,” a true Trafalgar blow, reminiscent of their decisive defeat by the English in 1805.

[“CHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own Board,” CHAI spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle told Reuters on Friday. “The CHAI Board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps. ”  The   organization, founded in 2002, is the largest program of the Clinton Foundation. It accounted for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the Clinton Foundation spent in 2014. CHAI may be a “separate legal entity” from the Clinton’s New York   charity, but it’s budget is included in the Clinton Foundation’s annual audited expenses, yearly reports, and is listed under “affiliated entities” on the Clinton Foundation website. Another Clinton Foundation initiative set to ignore the foreign donations ban is the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP). “If Secretary Clinton wins the election, we plan to spin CGEP into an independent entity to continue this important work,” CGEP   Frank Giustra, who founded the   organization with Bill Clinton in 2007, said Friday. “President Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world. ” Giustra is the   dollar Clinton Foundation donor and Canadian mining magnate who  —   along with Bill Clinton’s global connections and Hillary Clinton’s State Department  —   helped facilitate the transfer of 20 percent of the United States’ uranium supply to the Russian government, a revelation that first appeared in The New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash, authored by Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer. CHAI and CGEP’s apparent choice to ignore the Clinton Foundation’s ban on foreign money comes as Bill Clinton says he will resign from the Clinton Foundation board, should Hillary Clinton win in November. On Tuesday, the Boston Globe, which sits less than two miles from CHAI, called for the “shut down” of the Clinton Foundation, should Hillary win. “Even if they’ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,” the Globe’s editorial board, which endorsed Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, wrote. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson', 'Charles Ortel, a successful investor and independent journalist, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Wednesday about the state and foreign governments investigating charity fraud at the Clinton Foundation, despite FBI Director James Comey’s decision not to charge Hillary Clinton for her handling of top secret emails while she was Secretary of State. [“Many month ago, I thought to myself charity fraud is a state matter. And because this is an international global charity, it’s a foreign matter,” said Ortel, who’s spent more than 15 months researching the Clinton Foundation’s public records, donor disclosure data, federal, and   tax filings.  “Let’s go after potential infractions. Let’s see if there’s potential illegal acts at the state level and at the foreign level,” he continued. Because if we go down those avenues, the President [Obama] cannot pardon those crimes. There’s no way that he can do that, neither by executive action or any other means. ” “And I can tell you that many states and many foreign countries are actively looking at this,” Ortel said. Ortel is the former Wall Street analyst who blew the lid on financial discrepancies at General Electric in 2007 before that company’s stock crashed the following year. Ortel has spent the last year researching and publishing proof of what he calls “the largest unprosecuted charity fraud ever attempted  —   that being the network of illegal activities worldwide whose heart is the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. ” In his interview, Ortel told Bannon that “there are massive diversions” and “major discrepancies” between what donors reported that they gave to the Clinton Foundation and what the Clinton Foundation’s public disclosures said they received. “And they’re easy to track down,” Ortel said. “If I can do it, as a private citizen, imagine what government authorities and state and foreign levels can do. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

[Sky News reports that Butt, who they say came to Britain with his parents from Pakistan as asylum seekers, worked for Transport for London.  Further reports indicate Butt’s work gave him access to tunnels under the Houses of Parliament from the Westminster Underground Station  —   despite the fact he had been investigated for terror links by MI5 and even been featured on a Channel 4 documentary about   Islamists titled ‘The Jihadis Next Door‘. Pakistani security officials told The Telegraph newspaper that raids on homes and businesses connected to the Butt family were being carried out as a precaution, but that the terrorist was likely radicalised in Britain and trained in Syria. “Our British counterparts told us they don’t think he was radicalised here, and we think it is probably more likely that he was trained in Syria,” one said. “But we are searching the homes of any relatives connected to him and we are tracing all telephone calls made by family members. ” The news comes as Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley declared Britain was now facing a “completely different” level of threat and indicated that current policing and security methods are not equal to the task of containing it. “In nine weeks, we’ve had five plots foiled and three successful attacks. That is completely different to anything we have seen for a long time,” he said. “As the Prime Minister has indicated, we’re going to need to do some things differently. We’re going to have to think again about the next iteration of our police and security service model, which has constantly had to innovate over many decades. ” Regarding Butt, the Assistant Commissioner defended the decision to drop an inquiry into his activities by saying there was “no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned”. He added that he expected the authorities “will probably discover information on covert communications that were [not in] our knowledge that if we had access to those communications it may have changed our judgment” suggesting he wants new powers to monitor encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp.', 'Angela Merkel claims that the European Union still has a “responsibility” to take in more   refugees, and pleaded to Islamic governments to help convince people that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam. [The    German chancellor began her speech by acknowledging that “the European Union right now is in a very difficult situation due to the result of the British referendum   …     which is very regrettable”.  While calling on the bloc “to do more to integrate our military capacity” she also confessed it could not fight terrorism without U. S. president Donald Trump’s assistance. “Let me address this very openly. The Europeans alone could not cope with fighting international Islamist terrorism. We need the strength and the power of the United States of America, and their support,” she said. “I say this because the external borders of the European Union, in a way, are the border that actually separates us from Islamist terrorism, and that very much has an influence on Europe. “So   with the United States of America is most important for us, but what’s also very important to me is that Islamist, Muslim states have been incorporated in this coalition, because I think those countries, first and foremost, have to give a contribution. ” According to Chancellor Merkel, however, working with such states is the only way “we will be able to convince people that it is not Islam that is the problem, but a falsely understood Islam, and the religious authorities of Islam have to find strong language in order to delineate themselves and distance themselves from this fundamentalist and terrorist [version of] Islam. ” “We cannot do this, we Christians,” she said. “It has to be done by the Islamist clergy and by the religious authorities. ” Having claimed that Western institutions have no authority to tackle extremist ideology, however, the chancellor went on to insist that Europe does still have a duty to absorb more migrants. “We have a responsibility. The European Union has a responsibility to bear, accepting those refugees. “Just think, Cyprus, after all, is a neighbouring state to Syria, so you see the external borders of the Union are the borders that separate us from those areas where people amass in great numbers   …     [W]e cannot simply say it’s got nothing to do with us we have to deal with this issue. ” Cyprus does not in fact share a land border with Syria, being an island nation some 315 miles from the Syrian coast.', 'Washington (CNN) Diplomatic relations between the U. S. and Russia began to unravel after Moscow said Saturday it had expelled two American diplomats and the U. S. revealed it had tossed two Russians in response to an attack on one of its personnel. ”On June 17, we expelled two Russian officials from the United States to respond to this attack,” State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN, referring to an American diplomat who the spokesman said ”was attacked by a Russian policeman” while trying to enter the U. S. embassy last month in Moscow. Russia revealed Saturday it had responded in kind.  According to Russian State News Agency Sputnik, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said two Americans were declared persona non grata after an ”unfriendly move” by the U. S. that was not specified. The State Department declined to comment directly on that report.  Sputnik also reported on the U. S. expulsion of the two Russians:   ”(T) he U. S. government really has demanded the departure of two staff members of the Russian Embassy in Washington, D. C. without presenting any complaints to them. And the U. S. State Department at a high level proposed us not to make this fact public. As you can see, American diplomats don’t stand by their own words,” Ryabkov said, according to Sputnik. The U. S.     comes as the State Department on Friday condemned Russian security services for an attack on the American diplomat, the latest incident in what U. S. officials said is increasing intimidation of its personnel. The U. S. diplomat ”was attacked by a Russian policeman” while attempting to enter the American embassy last month in Moscow, Kirby told reporters, speaking just days after a video of the altercation was broadcast on Russian TV. ”The action was unprovoked and endangered the safety of our employee,” he added. Kirby said that Russian officials’ claims that the policeman was attempting to protect the embassy were ”simply untrue.”   He called this a ”very graphic and violent example” of two years of ”increased harassment” of U. S. diplomats in Russia.  He noted that Washington had initially sought to handle the affair via direct    channels but said that Russian officials’ public allegations compelled the U. S. to make the rebuke public.  He described Russian behavior as ”unprovoked and unnecessary.”  ”There’s no need for this when there’s so many more important things for us to be working on with Russia,” he added.  Washington had delivered   complaints to Moscow about accusations of increasing intimidation of American diplomats in Russia, the State Department said in June. Secretary of State John Kerry last discussed the matter with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 24, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters last month. ”We see an increase and we take it seriously,” she said. Other Western embassies had reported the same behavior toward their diplomats stationed in Moscow, Trudeau added. In June, the Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow has ”felt a significant increase in pressure on the Russian Embassy and consulates general of our country in the United States.” According to Zakharova, staff members of Russia’s consulate missions abroad ”regularly become the objects of provocations by the American secret services, face obstacles in making official contacts and other restrictions,” including travel.  Kirby dismissed the Russian complaints about their U. S.  diplomats receiving similar treatment, calling the claims ”without foundation.” The Russian embassy in the U. S. did not have any immediate comment Saturday.  The diplomatic incident comes after several recent military close calls between Russia and the United States. In the most recent incident, a Russian ship last week came within 150 yards of a U. S. Navy vessel, the USS San Jacinto, that was sailing in the eastern Mediterranean. The U. S. Navy described the maneuver in a statement as unsafe, ”erratic” and ”aggressive.” RELATED: Experts: Putin flexes muscles with   military close calls, A few weeks earlier, the Russian   frigate came within 315 yards of the USS Gravely. And in April, two Russian fighter jets flew within 30 feet of the USS Donald Cook while it was sailing in the Baltic Sea, an action that U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned could have led to the jets being shot down.', 'The race is on to be the new London. Unless Britain finds a way to undo its decision to leave the European Union, London’s days as the   global financial capital, ranked even ahead of New York, may be numbered. I spoke this week to several   executives at major financial institutions that collectively employ tens of thousands in London. While none of them have any immediate plans to move their European headquarters from Britain’s capital, all agreed they would eventually shift a significant number of highly paid employees to cities that remain in the European Union. One executive in charge of relocation (who like the others, spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue) said the percentage of employees in his firm who might be required to move ranged from 10 percent to 40 percent. “Multiply that throughout the industry and it’s tens of thousands of people and their families,” he said. “And bear in mind that most of these people are millionaires. ” Others said it would take five to 10 years, but a new London would almost certainly emerge in one of the other prominent cities of the European Union. “When I moved to London years ago, it wasn’t exactly cosmopolitan,” said another executive. “It wasn’t a place for great restaurants. The infrastructure has improved dramatically. It will take time, but eventually one big hub will develop. ” Who might win this   financial sweepstakes? To handicap the race, I asked relocation experts at major firms to describe what they are looking for in a replacement for London. I also spoke to Mark Yeandle, a director of the   Group in London and lead author of the Global Financial Centers Index, which ranks cities based on their attractiveness to financial services businesses. (Before last week’s vote, London was far and away the winner.) Here are the criteria most frequently mentioned:   facility, which is essential for attracting a global work force a favorable regulatory environment, especially regarding employment excellent transportation and communications infrastructure availability of prime office space and luxury housing good schools good restaurants and cultural offerings and finally, an intangible quality that includes a certain energy level and openness to an influx of highly paid, competitive City of   Street types. I scored numerous cities in the European Union on a   scale: five points for office space and housing, five points for restaurants and cultural offerings  —   because it’s easier for any city to build new offices and housing, and import talented chefs and entertainers  —   and 10 points for each of the others. For   facility, I used the European Union’s 2012 survey, “Europeans and Their Languages. ” For the regulatory environment, I used the rankings from the World Bank. For airports, I combined   departure statistics with a leading passenger satisfaction survey. To evaluate schools, I consulted Harriet Plyler, editor of “The Good Schools Guide International,” and the Pearson Learning Curve Index. For restaurants, culture and quality of life, I used Mercer Consulting’s Quality of Living Survey and a ranking of cities based on the number of   restaurants for cost and availability of offices and luxury housing I used the Global Property Guide. Here, in ascending order, are the top nine, including the winner: Barcelona, Spain (23 points)  Several executives spoke wistfully of moving to sunny Barcelona, with its excellent restaurants, cafe scene, night life and proximity to Mediterranean beaches. But other than a relatively good airport, Barcelona fails nearly every other test, starting with   facility: Just 22 percent of Spaniards have a conversational knowledge of English. “Barcelona is great for a holiday,” Mr. Yeandle said, “but not as a place to do business. ” Milan (24 points)  Much the same could be said of Milan. Italians are a little more fluent in English  —   34 percent  —   and Milan has excellent restaurants and arguably the best shopping in the world. It’s already Italy’s financial center. But it lags in every other category, including business climate, where Italy is ranked 45th by the World Bank. Its two main airports are badly in need of refurbishing. Warsaw (24 points) Poland’s appeal is primarily its flexible labor laws, favorable business climate, a     populace and a low cost of living. Warsaw would welcome an influx of financial professionals with open arms, in contrast to many more affluent European cities. But it ranks very low on Mercer’s quality of life index, and luxury housing is limited. Still, one major banker told me his firm would move a contingent there from London and expand its technology operations, though its top investment banking professionals would balk at the idea of relocating there. Luxembourg  (40 points) Residents of Luxembourg are the most affluent and multilingual in Europe (56 percent speak English, and 84 percent speak at least two foreign languages). Known in part as a tax haven, it is already a sophisticated financial services center, and is home to the European Investment Bank and the European Court of Justice. Mercer ranks it relatively high on quality of life (19th in the world) and it has a surprising number of   restaurants, a reflection of its proximity to France. But the World Bank rates its business climate last among these finalists. Its international airport ranks a dismal 99th. And the entire country had a population of just 576, 000 at the beginning of this year. London has more than 360, 000 employees in its financial services sector alone. It’s hard to imagine how Luxembourg could absorb even a small percentage of them. Paris (43 points) Already a major financial services center and easily the most culturally appealing city in the European Union, Paris seems an obvious choice. Its regional population of 12 million is the only one that rivals London. But Paris’s score is dragged down by almost every other category. Only 39 percent of the French are fluent in English, and despite big improvements in recent years, they maintain a reputation of being inhospitable to people who don’t speak French well. Its airports have low rankings and its rigid school system is inhospitable to foreigners (although it has excellent   private schools). France has strict limits on the ability to fire people, and it ranks just 27th on the World Bank’s list. Paris is among the most expensive cities in Europe after London, and is a distant 37th on Mercer’s quality of life index. Every financial services executive I interviewed mentioned an intangible factor: French hostility to the wealthy. President François Hollande tried to impose a 75 percent “wealth tax,” which prompted an exodus of rich French citizens before Mr. Hollande dropped the proposal. “All the noise coming out of the Élysée Palace the last few years has been that France wants to tax or regulate financial service companies out of business,” Mr. Yeandle said. “Financial services people are furious. ” Dublin (50 points) Not surprisingly, Dublin gets top scores for   facility (albeit with an Irish lilt) and also for excellent schools. Dublin is charming, with good restaurants, theater and night life. It offers many of London’s advantages, but is much less expensive. It ranks high on ease of doing business, and of all the European capitals, is probably the most enthusiastic about attracting   talent from London. The Industrial Development Agency Ireland is already reaching out to financial institutions to entice them to Ireland, the Irish Times reported. Several banking executives told me they would definitely be moving some operations to Dublin. Dublin’s main drawback is its relatively small size (1. 8 million people in the metropolitan area) and lack of infrastructure. Dublin is more distant from the European Union’s other countries and it lacks London’s direct rail link to the Continent. Its relatively small airport ranked 80th. Vienna (51 points) Vienna emerged as a surprisingly viable contender. Seventy three percent of Austria’s population is fluent in English its rank in ease of doing business is just behind Ireland’s Vienna has an excellent airport with high   performance, and it is Mercer’s   city in the world for quality of life. Its restaurants and wines have attracted international acclaim. “It’s a fantastic place to live,” Mr. Yeandle said. Like Paris, Vienna has the air of a world capital, which it was until Austria lost its empire after the First World War. And that, bankers told me, is part of the problem: Vienna feels like it has been asleep for much of the last century. It’s not a major financial capital now, and no one I spoke to has any immediate plans to start or expand operations there. Still, they told me they might have to reconsider. Frankfurt (54 points) In many ways Frankfurt is the obvious choice, because it is already home to the European Central Bank. It’s the financial capital of Germany, Europe’s largest economy and dominant political force. It ranks high on the ease of doing business index, although German labor laws can be as rigid as the French’s. After Heathrow outside London, it has the   European airport, next to a modern rail terminal connecting it to every major city in Europe. Its population of 2. 5 million could absorb a large influx of financial professionals. But some of those same factors work against it. Even as most people I spoke with said Frankfurt would most likely emerge as the next London, they didn’t seem very enthusiastic about it. Some already think there’s too much power in Germany  —   and that London has acted as a financial counterbalance. And some said Frankfurt was simply too boring. It ranks low on the   rankings (and far behind other German cities like Berlin and Munich) and isn’t known for its night life or culture. Language and schooling are potential drawbacks as well. And the winner is: Amsterdam (55 points) Not only do 90 percent of the Dutch speak English, many speak it better than the English themselves. Its schools are ranked the best in Europe, and there are plenty of   options. The city has beautiful architecture and housing options, picturesque canals, excellent restaurants, music and theater, lively night life, and a cosmopolitan and tolerant attitude cultivated over centuries as a major global trading center. It has one of Europe’s best airports, ranked just behind Frankfurt and Vienna, and an excellent rail network connecting major European capitals, including London. It’s a short train ride to Brussels, the capital of the European Union. Amsterdam is already a center of international commerce and the financial and political capital of the Netherlands. It did lose a few points for its business and regulatory climate: The World Bank ranks the Netherlands 28th, just behind Switzerland and France. The problem? Badly hurt by the financial crisis, the Dutch have capped bankers’ bonuses at just 20 percent of their annual salaries  —   a far more drastic curb than was imposed by the European Union. Several bankers told me that unless the Dutch repealed the cap, they wouldn’t consider moving to Amsterdam. “I’d love to relocate to Amsterdam,” one top executive told me. “But I don’t think we’re wanted there. ” Out of curiosity, I examined the same criteria and scored London itself. The result? London earns a   58 points. The only black mark was its quality of life, primarily because of its high cost. Mercer ranks London just 39th (New York ranks 44th). “London has so many advantages,” Mr. Yeandle said. “I think that will remain true even if it’s outside the E. U. But if the vote costs London its   that will be a   tragedy. ”', '  49er Colin Kaepernick spoke with media in South Florida on Wednesday in advance of San Francisco’s game against the Miami Dolphins that takes place at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on Sunday. Instead of the customary media conference call, this one turn into a heated political debate. [Things grew testy between Kaepernick and a particular media member of Cuban descent, in regards to Kaepernick’s past wearing of a Fidel Castro  . According to the Palm Beach Post, “When pressed about the shirt, Kaepernick first pointed out that Malcolm X also was pictured. Kaepernick said he supports Malcolm X and his willingness to be “ ” before forming his own views of the world. Part of that   he said, was meeting with the Cuban leader. ”  The Miami Herald reporter pressed Kaepernick about Castro, prompting Kaepernick to say, “I’m not talking about Fidel Castro and his oppression. I’m talking about Malcolm X and what he’s done for people. ” The reporter confronted Kaepernick after the quarterback steered the conversation away from the “uncomfortable” topic of Castro. Kaepernick shot back, “One thing that Fidel Castro did do is they have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here, even though we’re fully capable of doing that. ” When the reporter challenged Kaepernick on Castro’s history of breaking up families, Kaepernick responded, “We do break up families here. That’s what mass incarceration is. That was the foundation of slavery so our country has been based on that as well as the genocide of native Americans. ” After the South Florida media cited a Sports Illustrated study which said that many fans stopped watching the NFL because of Kaepernick’s anthem protests, he responded by blaming the fans: “They’re not watching football because of my stance about fighting systematic oppression and wanting the same equality and freedom for all people. “I would say they probably need to look in the mirror at what they value. You know, if they’re OK with people being treated unfairly, being abused, being harassed, being terrorized, then the problem is more with what they’re doing in their lives than it is about watching football games. ” Even as the NFL remains perfectly unwilling to stop Kaepernick’s anthem protest, by insulting huge swaths of the NFL’s fan base and suggesting that disagreeing with his protest somehow makes them okay with the harassing and terrorizing of innocent people Kaepernick’s conduct on this phone call crosses a line that’s not protected by free speech, or any right to protest. The NFL has a recent precedent of cracking down on players whom they believe engage in conduct insulting or offensive to people at large, or certain groups in particular. In fact, the NFL exercised that power in Miami when they suspended and fined   safety Don Jones for tweeting “OMG” and “horrible” after Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on live television during the 2014 NFL Draft. If the NFL can use that kind of disciplinary action against a player for, in their opinion, offending the relatively small gay community then they can certainly exercise that same discipline against Kaepernick for his   rant against far larger segments of their fan base. Again, there’s no reason to believe the league will do that. But they could. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn']\n"
